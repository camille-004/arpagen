there is no one left
when mary lennox was sent to misselthwaite manor to live with her uncle everybody said she was the most disagreeablelooking child ever seen
it was true too
she had a little thin face and a little thin body thin light hair and a sour expression
her hair was yellow and her face was yellow because she had been born in india and had always been ill in one way or another
her father had held a position under the english
government and had always been busy and ill himself and her mother had been a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and amuse herself with gay people
so when she was a sickly fretful ugly little baby she was kept out of the way and when she became a sickly fretful toddling thing she was kept out of the way also
so if mary had not chosen to really want to know how to read books she would never have learned her letters at all
one frightfully hot morning when she was about nine years old she awakened feeling very cross and she became crosser still when she saw that the servant who stood by her bedside was not her ayah
why did you come
she said to the strange woman
i will not let you stay
send my ayah to me
there was something mysterious in the air that morning
nothing was done in its regular order and several of the native servants seemed missing while those whom mary saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scared faces
but no one would tell her anything and her ayah did not come
she was actually left alone as the morning went on and at last she wandered out into the garden and began to play by herself under a tree near the veranda
daughter of pigs
she said because to call a native a pig is the worst insult of all
she was grinding her teeth and saying this over and over again when she heard her mother come out on the veranda with some one
she was with a fair young man and they stood talking together in low strange voices
mary knew the fair young man who looked like a boy
she had heard that he was a very young officer who had just come from england
the child stared at him but she stared most at her mother
she always did this when she had a chance to see her because the mem sahibmary used to call her that oftener than anything elsewas such a tall slim pretty person and wore such lovely clothes
her hair was like curly silk and she had a delicate little nose which seemed to be disdaining things and she had large laughing eyes
all her clothes were thin and floating and
mary said they were full of lace
they looked fuller of lace than ever this morning but her eyes were not laughing at all
they were large and scared and lifted imploringly to the fair boy officers face
is it so very bad
mary heard her say
awfully the young man answered in a trembling voice
awfully mrs
you ought to have gone to the hills two weeks ago
the mem sahib wrung her hands
oh i know i ought
i only stayed to go to that silly dinner party
what a fool i was
at that very moment such a loud sound of wailing broke out from the servants quarters that she clutched the young mans arm and mary stood shivering from head to foot
the wailing grew wilder and wilder
what is it
what is it
lennox gasped
some one has died answered the boy officer
you did not say it had broken out among your servants
i did not know
the mem sahib cried
come with me
come with me
and she turned and ran into the house
after that appalling things happened and the mysteriousness of the morning was explained to mary
the cholera had broken out in its most fatal form and people were dying like flies
the ayah had been taken ill in the night and it was because she had just died that the servants had wailed in the huts
before the next day three other servants were dead and others had run away in terror
there was panic on every side and dying people in all the bungalows
during the confusion and bewilderment of the second day mary hid herself in the nursery and was forgotten by every one
nobody thought of her nobody wanted her and strange things happened of which she knew nothing
mary alternately cried and slept through the hours
she only knew that people were ill and that she heard mysterious and frightening sounds
the child ate some fruit and biscuits and being thirsty she drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled
it was sweet and she did not know how strong it was
very soon it made her intensely drowsy and she went back to her nursery and shut herself in again frightened by cries she heard in the huts and by the hurrying sound of feet
the wine made her so sleepy that she could scarcely keep her eyes open and she lay down on her bed and knew nothing more for a long time
many things happened during the hours in which she slept so heavily but she was not disturbed by the wails and the sound of things being carried in and out of the bungalow
when she awakened she lay and stared at the wall
the house was perfectly still
she had never known it to be so silent before
she heard neither voices nor footsteps and wondered if everybody had got well of the cholera and all the trouble was over
she wondered also who would take care of her now her ayah was dead
there would be a new ayah and perhaps she would know some new stories
mary had been rather tired of the old ones
she did not cry because her nurse had died
she was not an affectionate child and had never cared much for any one
the noise and hurrying about and wailing over the cholera had frightened her and she had been angry because no one seemed to remember that she was alive
every one was too panicstricken to think of a little girl no one was fond of
when people had the cholera it seemed that they remembered nothing but themselves
but if every one had got well again surely some one would remember and come to look for her
but no one came and as she lay waiting the house seemed to grow more and more silent
she heard something rustling on the matting and when she looked down she saw a little snake gliding along and watching her with eyes like jewels
she was not frightened because he was a harmless little thing who would not hurt her and he seemed in a hurry to get out of the room
he slipped under the door as she watched him
how queer and quiet it is she said
it sounds as if there was no one in the bungalow but me and the snake
almost the next minute she heard footsteps in the compound and then on the veranda
they were mens footsteps and the men entered the bungalow and talked in low voices
no one went to meet or speak to them and they seemed to open doors and look into rooms
what desolation
she heard one voice say
that pretty pretty woman
i suppose the child too
i heard there was a child though no one ever saw her
mary was standing in the middle of the nursery when they opened the door a few minutes later
she looked an ugly cross little thing and was frowning because she was beginning to be hungry and feel disgracefully neglected
the first man who came in was a large officer she had once seen talking to her father
he looked tired and troubled but when he saw her he was so startled that he almost jumped back
he cried out
there is a child here
a child alone
in a place like this
mercy on us who is she
i am mary lennox the little girl said drawing herself up stiffly
she thought the man was very rude to call her fathers bungalow a place like this
i fell asleep when every one had the cholera and i have only just wakened up
why does nobody come
it is the child no one ever saw
exclaimed the man turning to his companions
she has actually been forgotten
why was i forgotten
mary said stamping her foot
why does nobody come
the young man whose name was barney looked at her very sadly
mary even thought she saw him wink his eyes as if to wink tears away
poor little kid
there is nobody left to come
that was why the place was so quiet
it was true that there was no one in the bungalow but herself and the little rustling snake
chapter ii
mistress mary quite contrary
she did not miss her at all in fact and as she was a selfabsorbed child she gave her entire thought to herself as she had always done
if she had been older she would no doubt have been very anxious at being left alone in the world but she was very young and as she had always been taken care of she supposed she always would be
what she thought was that she would like to know if she was going to nice people who would be polite to her and give her her own way as her
ayah and the other native servants had done
she knew that she was not going to stay at the english clergymans house where she was taken at first
she did not want to stay
the english clergyman was poor and he had five children nearly all the same age and they wore shabby clothes and were always quarreling and snatching toys from each other
mary hated their untidy bungalow and was so disagreeable to them that after the first day or two nobody would play with her
by the second day they had given her a nickname which made her furious
it was basil who thought of it first
basil was a little boy with impudent blue eyes and a turnedup nose and mary hated him
she was playing by herself under a tree just as she had been playing the day the cholera broke out
she was making heaps of earth and paths for a garden and basil came and stood near to watch her
presently he got rather interested and suddenly made a suggestion
why dont you put a heap of stones there and pretend it is a rockery
there in the middle and he leaned over her to point
cried mary
i dont want boys
for a moment basil looked angry and then he began to tease
he was always teasing his sisters
he danced round and round her and made faces and sang and laughed
mistress mary quite contrary how does your garden grow
with silver bells and cockle shells and marigolds all in a row
mary quite contrary when they spoke of her to each other and often when they spoke to her
you are going to be sent home basil said to her at the end of the week
and were glad of it
i am glad of it too answered mary
where is home
she doesnt know where home is
said basil with sevenyearold scorn
its england of course
our grandmama lives there and our sister mabel was sent to her last year
you are not going to your grandmama
you have none
you are going to your uncle
his name is mr
archibald craven
i dont know anything about him snapped mary
i know you dont basil answered
you dont know anything
girls never do
i heard father and mother talking about him
he lives in a great big desolate old house in the country and no one goes near him
hes so cross he wont let them and they wouldnt come if he would let them
hes a hunchback and hes horrid
i dont believe you said mary and she turned her back and stuck her fingers in her ears because she would not listen any more
but she thought over it a great deal afterward and when mrs
crawford told her that night that she was going to sail away to england in a few days and go to her uncle mr
archibald craven who lived at
misselthwaite manor she looked so stony and stubbornly uninterested that they did not know what to think about her
they tried to be kind to her but she only turned her face away when mrs
crawford attempted to kiss her and held herself stiffly when mr
crawford patted her shoulder
she is such a plain child mrs
crawford said pityingly afterward
and her mother was such a pretty creature
she had a very pretty manner too and mary has the most unattractive ways i ever saw in a child
the children call her mistress mary quite contrary and though its naughty of them one cant help understanding it
perhaps if her mother had carried her pretty face and her pretty manners oftener into the nursery mary might have learned some pretty ways too
it is very sad now the poor beautiful thing is gone to remember that many people never even knew that she had a child at all
i believe she scarcely ever looked at her sighed mrs
when her ayah was dead there was no one to give a thought to the little thing
think of the servants running away and leaving her all alone in that deserted bungalow
colonel mcgrew said he nearly jumped out of his skin when he opened the door and found her standing by herself in the middle of the room
mary made the long voyage to england under the care of an officers wife who was taking her children to leave them in a boardingschool
she was very much absorbed in her own little boy and girl and was rather glad to hand the child over to the woman mr
archibald craven sent to meet her in london
the woman was his housekeeper at
misselthwaite manor and her name was mrs
she was a stout woman with very red cheeks and sharp black eyes
she wore a very purple dress a black silk mantle with jet fringe on it and a black bonnet with purple velvet flowers which stuck up and trembled when she moved her head
mary did not like her at all but as she very seldom liked people there was nothing remarkable in that besides which it was very evident
medlock did not think much of her
shes a plain little piece of goods
and wed heard that her mother was a beauty
she hasnt handed much of it down has she maam
perhaps she will improve as she grows older the officers wife said goodnaturedly
if she were not so sallow and had a nicer expression her features are rather good
children alter so much
shell have to alter a good deal answered mrs
and theres nothing likely to improve children at misselthwaiteif you ask me
they thought mary was not listening because she was standing a little apart from them at the window of the private hotel they had gone to
she was watching the passing buses and cabs and people but she heard quite well and was made very curious about her uncle and the place he lived in
what sort of a place was it and what would he be like
what was a hunchback
she had never seen one
perhaps there were none in india
since she had been living in other peoples houses and had had no ayah she had begun to feel lonely and to think queer thoughts which were new to her
she had begun to wonder why she had never seemed to belong to any one even when her father and mother had been alive
other children seemed to belong to their fathers and mothers but she had never seemed to really be any ones little girl
she had had servants and food and clothes but no one had taken any notice of her
she did not know that this was because she was a disagreeable child but then of course she did not know she was disagreeable
she often thought that other people were but she did not know that she was so herself
she thought mrs
medlock the most disagreeable person she had ever seen with her common highly colored face and her common fine bonnet
it would have made her very angry to think people imagined she was her little girl
medlock was not in the least disturbed by her and her thoughts
she was the kind of woman who would stand no nonsense from young ones
at least that is what she would have said if she had been asked
archibald craven told her to do
she never dared even to ask a question
captain lennox and his wife died of the cholera mr
craven had said in his short cold way
captain lennox was my wifes brother and i am their daughters guardian
the child is to be brought here
you must go to london and bring her yourself
so she packed her small trunk and made the journey
mary sat in her corner of the railway carriage and looked plain and fretful
she had nothing to read or to look at and she had folded her thin little blackgloved hands in her lap
her black dress made her look yellower than ever and her limp light hair straggled from under her black crpe hat
a more marredlooking young one i never saw in my life mrs
medlock thought
marred is a yorkshire word and means spoiled and pettish
she had never seen a child who sat so still without doing anything and at last she got tired of watching her and began to talk in a brisk hard voice
i suppose i may as well tell you something about where you are going to she said
do you know anything about your uncle
no said mary
never heard your father and mother talk about him
no said mary frowning
she frowned because she remembered that her father and mother had never talked to her about anything in particular
certainly they had never told her things
humph muttered mrs
medlock staring at her queer unresponsive little face
she did not say any more for a few moments and then she began again
i suppose you might as well be told somethingto prepare you
you are going to a queer place
mary said nothing at all and mrs
medlock looked rather discomfited by her apparent indifference but after taking a breath she went on
not but that its a grand big place in a gloomy way and mr
cravens proud of it in his wayand thats gloomy enough too
the house is six hundred years old and its on the edge of the moor and theres near a hundred rooms in it though most of thems shut up and locked
and theres pictures and fine old furniture and things thats been there for ages and theres a big park round it and gardens and trees with branches trailing to the groundsome of them
she paused and took another breath
but theres nothing else she ended suddenly
mary had begun to listen in spite of herself
it all sounded so unlike
india and anything new rather attracted her
but she did not intend to look as if she were interested
that was one of her unhappy disagreeable ways
so she sat still
well said mrs
what do you think of it
nothing she answered
i know nothing about such places
that made mrs
medlock laugh a short sort of laugh
she said but you are like an old woman
dont you care
it doesnt matter said mary whether i care or not
you are right enough there said mrs
what youre to be kept at misselthwaite manor for i dont know unless because its the easiest way
hes not going to trouble himself about you thats sure and certain
he never troubles himself about no one
she stopped herself as if she had just remembered something in time
hes got a crooked back she said
that set him wrong
he was a sour young man and got no good of all his money and big place till he was married
marys eyes turned toward her in spite of her intention not to seem to care
she had never thought of the hunchbacks being married and she was a trifle surprised
medlock saw this and as she was a talkative woman she continued with more interest
this was one way of passing some of the time at any rate
she was a sweet pretty thing and hed have walked the world over to get her a blade o grass she wanted
nobody thought shed marry him but she did and people said she married him for his money
but she didntshe didnt positively
when she died
mary gave a little involuntary jump
did she die
she exclaimed quite without meaning to
she had just remembered a french fairy story she had once read called riquet la
it had been about a poor hunchback and a beautiful princess and it had made her suddenly sorry for mr
archibald craven
yes she died mrs
medlock answered
and it made him queerer than ever
he cares about nobody
he wont see people
most of the time he goes away and when he is at misselthwaite he shuts himself up in the
west wing and wont let any one but pitcher see him
pitchers an old fellow but he took care of him when he was a child and he knows his ways
it sounded like something in a book and it did not make mary feel cheerful
a house with a hundred rooms nearly all shut up and with their doors lockeda house on the edge of a moorwhatsoever a moor wassounded dreary
a man with a crooked back who shut himself up also
she stared out of the window with her lips pinched together and it seemed quite natural that the rain should have begun to pour down in gray slanting lines and splash and stream down the windowpanes
if the pretty wife had been alive she might have made things cheerful by being something like her own mother and by running in and out and going to parties as she had done in frocks full of lace
but she was not there any more
you neednt expect to see him because ten to one you wont said mrs
and you mustnt expect that there will be people to talk to you
youll have to play about and look after yourself
youll be told what rooms you can go into and what rooms youre to keep out of
theres gardens enough
but when youre in the house dont go wandering and poking about
craven wont have it
i shall not want to go poking about said sour little mary and just as suddenly as she had begun to be rather sorry for mr
archibald craven she began to cease to be sorry and to think he was unpleasant enough to deserve all that had happened to him
and she turned her face toward the streaming panes of the window of the railway carriage and gazed out at the gray rainstorm which looked as if it would go on forever and ever
she watched it so long and steadily that the grayness grew heavier and heavier before her eyes and she fell asleep
chapter iii
across the moor
she slept a long time and when she awakened mrs
medlock had bought a lunchbasket at one of the stations and they had some chicken and cold beef and bread and butter and some hot tea
the rain seemed to be streaming down more heavily than ever and everybody in the station wore wet and glistening waterproofs
the guard lighted the lamps in the carriage and mrs
medlock cheered up very much over her tea and chicken and beef
she ate a great deal and afterward fell asleep herself and
mary sat and stared at her and watched her fine bonnet slip on one side until she herself fell asleep once more in the corner of the carriage lulled by the splashing of the rain against the windows
it was quite dark when she awakened again
the train had stopped at a station and
medlock was shaking her
you have had a sleep
its time to open your eyes
thwaite station and weve got a long drive before us
mary stood up and tried to keep her eyes open while mrs
medlock collected her parcels
the little girl did not offer to help her because in india native servants always picked up or carried things and it seemed quite proper that other people should wait on one
the station was a small one and nobody but themselves seemed to be getting out of the train
the stationmaster spoke to mrs
medlock in a rough goodnatured way pronouncing his words in a queer broad fashion which mary found out afterward was yorkshire
i see thas got back he said
an thas browt th young un with thee
aye thats her answered mrs
medlock speaking with a yorkshire accent herself and jerking her head over her shoulder toward mary
hows thy missus
th carriage is waitin outside for thee
a brougham stood on the road before the little outside platform
mary saw that it was a smart carriage and that it was a smart footman who helped her in
his long waterproof coat and the waterproof covering of his hat were shining and dripping with rain as everything was the burly stationmaster included
when he shut the door mounted the box with the coachman and they drove off the little girl found herself seated in a comfortably cushioned corner but she was not inclined to go to sleep again
she sat and looked out of the window curious to see something of the road over which she was being driven to the queer place mrs
medlock had spoken of
what is a moor
she said suddenly to mrs
look out of the window in about ten minutes and youll see the woman answered
weve got to drive five miles across missel moor before we get to the manor
you wont see much because its a dark night but you can see something
mary asked no more questions but waited in the darkness of her corner keeping her eyes on the window
the carriage lamps cast rays of light a little distance ahead of them and she caught glimpses of the things they passed
after they had left the station they had driven through a tiny village and she had seen whitewashed cottages and the lights of a public house
then they had passed a church and a vicarage and a little shopwindow or so in a cottage with toys and sweets and odd things set out for sale
then they were on the highroad and she saw hedges and trees
after that there seemed nothing different for a long timeor at least it seemed a long time to her
at last the horses began to go more slowly as if they were climbing uphill and presently there seemed to be no more hedges and no more trees
she could see nothing in fact but a dense darkness on either side
she leaned forward and pressed her face against the window just as the carriage gave a big jolt
were on the moor now sure enough said mrs
a wind was rising and making a singular wild low rushing sound
itsits not the sea is it
said mary looking round at her companion
no not it answered mrs
nor it isnt fields nor mountains its just miles and miles and miles of wild land that nothing grows on but heather and gorse and broom and nothing lives on but wild ponies and sheep
i feel as if it might be the sea if there were water on it said
it sounds like the sea just now
thats the wind blowing through the bushes mrs
medlock said
its a wild dreary enough place to my mind though theres plenty that likes itparticularly when the heathers in bloom
on and on they drove through the darkness and though the rain stopped the wind rushed by and whistled and made strange sounds
the road went up and down and several times the carriage passed over a little bridge beneath which water rushed very fast with a great deal of noise
mary felt as if the drive would never come to an end and that the wide bleak moor was a wide expanse of black ocean through which she was passing on a strip of dry land
i dont like it she said to herself
i dont like it and she pinched her thin lips more tightly together
the horses were climbing up a hilly piece of road when she first caught sight of a light
medlock saw it as soon as she did and drew a long sigh of relief
eh i am glad to see that bit o light twinkling she exclaimed
its the light in the lodge window
we shall get a good cup of tea after a bit at all events
they drove out of the vault into a clear space and stopped before an immensely long but lowbuilt house which seemed to ramble round a stone court
at first mary thought that there were no lights at all in the windows but as she got out of the carriage she saw that one room in a corner upstairs showed a dull glow
the entrance door was a huge one made of massive curiously shaped panels of oak studded with big iron nails and bound with great iron bars
it opened into an enormous hall which was so dimly lighted that the faces in the portraits on the walls and the figures in the suits of armor made mary feel that she did not want to look at them
as she stood on the stone floor she looked a very small odd little black figure and she felt as small and lost and odd as she looked
a neat thin old man stood near the manservant who opened the door for them
you are to take her to her room he said in a husky voice
he doesnt want to see her
hes going to london in the morning
very well mr
pitcher mrs
medlock answered
so long as i know whats expected of me i can manage
whats expected of you mrs
medlock mr
pitcher said is that you make sure that hes not disturbed and that he doesnt see what he doesnt want to see
medlock said unceremoniously well here you are
this room and the next are where youll liveand you must keep to them
dont you forget that
it was in this way mistress mary arrived at misselthwaite manor and she had perhaps never felt quite so contrary in all her life
chapter iv
when she opened her eyes in the morning it was because a young housemaid had come into her room to light the fire and was kneeling on the hearthrug raking out the cinders noisily
mary lay and watched her for a few moments and then began to look about the room
she had never seen a room at all like it and thought it curious and gloomy
the walls were covered with tapestry with a forest scene embroidered on it
there were fantastically dressed people under the trees and in the distance there was a glimpse of the turrets of a castle
there were hunters and horses and dogs and ladies
mary felt as if she were in the forest with them
out of a deep window she could see a great climbing stretch of land which seemed to have no trees on it and to look rather like an endless dull purplish sea
what is that
she said pointing out of the window
martha the young housemaid who had just risen to her feet looked and pointed also
that there
thats th moor with a goodnatured grin
does tha like it
no answered mary
thats because thart not used to it martha said going back to her hearth
tha thinks its too big an bare now
but tha will like it
inquired mary
aye that i do answered martha cheerfully polishing away at the grate
i just love it
its none bare
its covered wi growin things as smells sweet
its fair lovely in spring an summer when th gorse an broom an heathers in flower
it smells o honey an theres such a lot o fresh airan th sky looks so high an th bees an skylarks makes such a nice noise hummin an singin
i wouldnt live away from th moor for anythin
mary listened to her with a grave puzzled expression
the native servants she had been used to in india were not in the least like this
they were obsequious and servile and did not presume to talk to their masters as if they were their equals
they made salaams and called them protector of the poor and names of that sort
indian servants were commanded to do things not asked
it was not the custom to say please and thank you and mary had always slapped her ayah in the face when she was angry
she wondered a little what this girl would do if one slapped her in the face
she was a round rosy goodnatured looking creature but she had a sturdy way which made mistress mary wonder if she might not even slap backif the person who slapped her was only a little girl
you are a strange servant she said from her pillows rather haughtily
martha sat up on her heels with her blackingbrush in her hand and laughed without seeming the least out of temper
i know that she said
if there was a grand missus at
misselthwaite i should never have been even one of th under housemaids
i might have been let to be scullerymaid but id never have been let upstairs
im too common an i talk too much yorkshire
but this is a funny house for all its so grand
seems like theres neither master nor
mistress except mr
pitcher an mrs
craven he wont be troubled about anythin when hes here an hes nearly always away
medlock gave me th place out o kindness
she told me she could never have done it if misselthwaite had been like other big houses
are you going to be my servant
mary asked still in her imperious little indian way
martha began to rub her grate again
medlocks servant she said stoutly
an shes mr
cravensbut im to do the housemaids work up here an wait on you a bit
but you wont need much waitin on
who is going to dress me
demanded mary
martha sat up on her heels again and stared
she spoke in broad
yorkshire in her amazement
canna tha dress thysen
what do you mean
i dont understand your language said mary
i forgot martha said
medlock told me id have to be careful or you wouldnt know what i was sayin
i mean cant you put on your own clothes
no answered mary quite indignantly
i never did in my life
my ayah dressed me of course
well said martha evidently not in the least aware that she was impudent its time tha should learn
tha cannot begin younger
itll do thee good to wait on thysen a bit
my mother always said she couldnt see why grand peoples children didnt turn out fair foolswhat with nurses an bein washed an dressed an took out to walk as if they was puppies
it is different in india said mistress mary disdainfully
she could scarcely stand this
but martha was not at all crushed
i can see its different she answered almost sympathetically
i dare say its because theres such a lot o blacks there instead o respectable white people
when i heard you was comin from india i thought you was a black too
mary sat up in bed furious
you thought i was a native
youyou daughter of a pig
martha stared and looked hot
who are you callin names
you neednt be so vexed
thats not th way for a young lady to talk
ive nothin against th blacks
when you read about em in tracts theyre always very religious
you always read as a blacks a man an a brother
ive never seen a black an i was fair pleased to think i was goin to see one close
when i come in to light your fire this mornin i crep up to your bed an pulled th cover back careful to look at you
an there you was disappointedly no more black than mefor all youre so yeller
mary did not even try to control her rage and humiliation
you thought i was a native
you dont know anything about natives
they are not peopletheyre servants who must salaam to you
you know nothing about india
you know nothing about anything
she sobbed so unrestrainedly that goodnatured yorkshire martha was a little frightened and quite sorry for her
she went to the bed and bent over her
you mustnt cry like that there
she begged
you mustnt for sure
i didnt know youd be vexed
i dont know anythin about anythinjust like you said
i beg your pardon miss
do stop cryin
there was something comforting and really friendly in her queer
yorkshire speech and sturdy way which had a good effect on mary
she gradually ceased crying and became quiet
martha looked relieved
its time for thee to get up now she said
medlock said i was to carry tha breakfast an tea an dinner into th room next to this
its been made into a nursery for thee
ill help thee on with thy clothes if thall get out o bed
if th buttons are at th back tha cannot button them up thaself
when mary at last decided to get up the clothes martha took from the wardrobe were not the ones she had worn when she arrived the night before with mrs
those are not mine she said
mine are black
she looked the thick white wool coat and dress over and added with cool approval those are nicer than mine
these are th ones tha must put on martha answered
craven ordered mrs
medlock to get em in london
he said i wont have a child dressed in black wanderin about like a lost soul he said
itd make the place sadder than it is
put color on her
mother she said she knew what he meant
mother always knows what a body means
she doesnt hold with black hersel
i hate black things said mary
the dressing process was one which taught them both something
martha had buttoned up her little sisters and brothers but she had never seen a child who stood still and waited for another person to do things for her as if she had neither hands nor feet of her own
why doesnt tha put on tha own shoes
she said when mary quietly held out her foot
my ayah did it answered mary staring
it was the custom
she said that very oftenit was the custom
the native servants were always saying it
if one told them to do a thing their ancestors had not done for a thousand years they gazed at one mildly and said it is not the custom and one knew that was the end of the matter
manor would end by teaching her a number of things quite new to herthings such as putting on her own shoes and stockings and picking up things she let fall
if mary lennox had been a child who was ready to be amused she would perhaps have laughed at marthas readiness to talk but mary only listened to her coldly and wondered at her freedom of manner
at first she was not at all interested but gradually as the girl rattled on in her goodtempered homely way mary began to notice what she was saying
you should see em all she said
theres twelve of us an my father only gets sixteen shilling a week
i can tell you my mothers put to it to get porridge for em all
they tumble about on th moor an play there all day an mother says th air of th moor fattens em
she says she believes they eat th grass same as th wild ponies do
dickon hes twelve years old and hes got a young pony he calls his own
where did he get it
asked mary
he found it on th moor with its mother when it was a little one an he began to make friends with it an give it bits o bread an pluck young grass for it
and it got to like him so it follows him about an it lets him get on its back
dickons a kind lad an animals likes him
mary had never possessed an animal pet of her own and had always thought she should like one
so she began to feel a slight interest in dickon and as she had never before been interested in any one but herself it was the dawning of a healthy sentiment
when she went into the room which had been made into a nursery for her she found that it was rather like the one she had slept in
it was not a childs room but a grownup persons room with gloomy old pictures on the walls and heavy old oak chairs
a table in the center was set with a good substantial breakfast
but she had always had a very small appetite and she looked with something more than indifference at the first plate martha set before her
i dont want it she said
tha doesnt want thy porridge
martha exclaimed incredulously
tha doesnt know how good it is
put a bit o treacle on it or a bit o sugar
i dont want it repeated mary
said martha
i cant abide to see good victuals go to waste
if our children was at this table theyd clean it bare in five minutes
said mary coldly
echoed martha
because they scarce ever had their stomachs full in their lives
theyre as hungry as young hawks an foxes
i dont know what it is to be hungry said mary with the indifference of ignorance
martha looked indignant
well it would do thee good to try it
i can see that plain enough she said outspokenly
ive no patience with folk as sits an just stares at good bread an meat
dont i wish dickon and phil an
jane an th rest of em had whats here under their pinafores
why dont you take it to them
suggested mary
its not mine answered martha stoutly
an this isnt my day out
i get my day out once a month same as th rest
then i go home an clean up for mother an give her a days rest
mary drank some tea and ate a little toast and some marmalade
you wrap up warm an run out an play you said martha
itll do you good and give you some stomach for your meat
mary went to the window
there were gardens and paths and big trees but everything looked dull and wintry
why should i go out on a day like this
well if tha doesnt go out thalt have to stay in an what has tha got to do
mary glanced about her
there was nothing to do
medlock had prepared the nursery she had not thought of amusement
perhaps it would be better to go and see what the gardens were like
who will go with me
she inquired
martha stared
youll go by yourself she answered
youll have to learn to play like other children does when they havent got sisters and brothers
dickon goes off on th moor by himself an plays for hours
thats how he made friends with th pony
hes got sheep on th moor that knows him an birds as comes an eats out of his hand
however little there is to eat he always saves a bit o his bread to coax his pets
it was really this mention of dickon which made mary decide to go out though she was not aware of it
there would be birds outside though there would not be ponies or sheep
they would be different from the birds in india and it might amuse her to look at them
martha found her coat and hat for her and a pair of stout little boots and she showed her her way downstairs
if tha goes round that way thall come to th gardens she said pointing to a gate in a wall of shrubbery
theres lots o flowers in summertime but theres nothin bloomin now
she seemed to hesitate a second before she added one of th gardens is locked up
no one has been in it for ten years
asked mary in spite of herself
here was another locked door added to the hundred in the strange house
craven had it shut when his wife died so sudden
he wont let no one go inside
it was her garden
he locked th door an dug a hole and buried th key
theres mrs
medlocks bell ringingi must run
after she was gone mary turned down the walk which led to the door in the shrubbery
she could not help thinking about the garden which no one had been into for ten years
she wondered what it would look like and whether there were any flowers still alive in it
when she had passed through the shrubbery gate she found herself in great gardens with wide lawns and winding walks with clipped borders
there were trees and flowerbeds and evergreens clipped into strange shapes and a large pool with an old gray fountain in its midst
but the flowerbeds were bare and wintry and the fountain was not playing
this was not the garden which was shut up
how could a garden be shut up
you could always walk into a garden
she was just thinking this when she saw that at the end of the path she was following there seemed to be a long wall with ivy growing over it
she was not familiar enough with england to know that she was coming upon the kitchengardens where the vegetables and fruit were growing
she went toward the wall and found that there was a green door in the ivy and that it stood open
this was not the closed garden evidently and she could go into it
she went through the door and found that it was a garden with walls all round it and that it was only one of several walled gardens which seemed to open into one another
she saw another open green door revealing bushes and pathways between beds containing winter vegetables
fruittrees were trained flat against the wall and over some of the beds there were glass frames
the place was bare and ugly enough mary thought as she stood and stared about her
it might be nicer in summer when things were green but there was nothing pretty about it now
presently an old man with a spade over his shoulder walked through the door leading from the second garden
he looked startled when he saw
mary and then touched his cap
what is this place
one o th kitchengardens he answered
what is that
said mary pointing through the other green door
another of em shortly
theres another on tother side o th wall an theres th orchard tother side o that
can i go in them
asked mary
if tha likes
but theres nowt to see
mary made no response
she went down the path and through the second green door
there she found more walls and winter vegetables and glass frames but in the second wall there was another green door and it was not open
perhaps it led into the garden which no one had seen for ten years
as she was not at all a timid child and always did what she wanted to do mary went to the green door and turned the handle
she hoped the door would not open because she wanted to be sure she had found the mysterious gardenbut it did open quite easily and she walked through it and found herself in an orchard
there were walls all round it also and trees trained against them and there were bare fruittrees growing in the winterbrowned grassbut there was no green door to be seen anywhere
she listened to him until he flew away
he was not like an indian bird and she liked him and wondered if she should ever see him again
perhaps he lived in the mysterious garden and knew all about it
perhaps it was because she had nothing whatever to do that she thought so much of the deserted garden
she was curious about it and wanted to see what it was like
why had mr
archibald craven buried the key
if he had liked his wife so much why did he hate her garden
people never like me and i never like people she thought
and i never can talk as the crawford children could
they were always talking and laughing and making noises
she thought of the robin and of the way he seemed to sing his song at her and as she remembered the treetop he perched on she stopped rather suddenly on the path
i believe that tree was in the secret gardeni feel sure it was she said
there was a wall round the place and there was no door
she walked back into the first kitchengarden she had entered and found the old man digging there
she went and stood beside him and watched him a few moments in her cold little way
he took no notice of her and so at last she spoke to him
i have been into the other gardens she said
there was nothin to prevent thee he answered crustily
i went into the orchard
there was no dog at th door to bite thee he answered
there was no door there into the other garden said mary
what garden
he said in a rough voice stopping his digging for a moment
the one on the other side of the wall answered mistress mary
there are trees therei saw the tops of them
a bird with a red breast was sitting on one of them and he sang
to her surprise the surly old weatherbeaten face actually changed its expression
a slow smile spread over it and the gardener looked quite different
it made her think that it was curious how much nicer a person looked when he smiled
she had not thought of it before
he turned about to the orchard side of his garden and began to whistlea low soft whistle
she could not understand how such a surly man could make such a coaxing sound
almost the next moment a wonderful thing happened
she heard a soft little rushing flight through the airand it was the bird with the red breast flying to them and he actually alighted on the big clod of earth quite near to the gardeners foot
here he is chuckled the old man and then he spoke to the bird as if he were speaking to a child
where has tha been tha cheeky little beggar
ive not seen thee before today
has tha begun tha courtin this early in th season
thart too forrad
the bird put his tiny head on one side and looked up at him with his soft bright eye which was like a black dewdrop
he seemed quite familiar and not the least afraid
he hopped about and pecked the earth briskly looking for seeds and insects
it actually gave mary a queer feeling in her heart because he was so pretty and cheerful and seemed so like a person
he had a tiny plump body and a delicate beak and slender delicate legs
will he always come when you call him
she asked almost in a whisper
aye that he will
ive knowed him ever since he was a fledgling
he come out of th nest in th other garden an when first he flew over th wall he was too weak to fly back for a few days an we got friendly
when he went over th wall again th rest of th brood was gone an he was lonely an he come back to me
what kind of a bird is he
mary asked
doesnt tha know
hes a robin redbreast an theyre th friendliest curiousest birds alive
theyre almost as friendly as dogsif you know how to get on with em
watch him peckin about there an lookin round at us now an again
he knows were talkin about him
it was the queerest thing in the world to see the old fellow
he looked at the plump little scarletwaistcoated bird as if he were both proud and fond of him
hes a conceited one he chuckled
he likes to hear folk talk about him
an curiousbless me there never was his like for curiosity an meddlin
hes always comin to see what im plantin
he knows all th things mester craven never troubles hissel to find out
hes th head gardener he is
the robin hopped about busily pecking the soil and now and then stopped and looked at them a little
mary thought his black dewdrop eyes gazed at her with great curiosity
it really seemed as if he were finding out all about her
the queer feeling in her heart increased
where did the rest of the brood fly to
theres no knowin
the old ones turn em out o their nest an make em fly an theyre scattered before you know it
this one was a knowin one an he knew he was lonely
mistress mary went a step nearer to the robin and looked at him very hard
im lonely she said
she had not known before that this was one of the things which made her feel sour and cross
she seemed to find it out when the robin looked at her and she looked at the robin
the old gardener pushed his cap back on his bald head and stared at her a minute
art tha th little wench from india
mary nodded
then no wonder thart lonely
thalt be lonelier before thas done he said
he began to dig again driving his spade deep into the rich black garden soil while the robin hopped about very busily employed
what is your name
mary inquired
he stood up to answer her
ben weatherstaff he answered and then he added with a surly chuckle im lonely mysel except when hes with me and he jerked his thumb toward the robin
hes th only friend ive got
i have no friends at all said mary
i never had
my ayah didnt like me and i never played with any one
it is a yorkshire habit to say what you think with blunt frankness and old ben weatherstaff was a yorkshire moor man
tha an me are a good bit alike he said
we was wove out of th same cloth
were neither of us good lookin an were both of us as sour as we look
weve got the same nasty tempers both of us ill warrant
this was plain speaking and mary lennox had never heard the truth about herself in her life
native servants always salaamed and submitted to you whatever you did
she had never thought much about her looks but she wondered if she was as unattractive as ben weatherstaff and she also wondered if she looked as sour as he had looked before the robin came
she actually began to wonder also if she was nasty tempered
she felt uncomfortable
suddenly a clear rippling little sound broke out near her and she turned round
she was standing a few feet from a young appletree and the robin had flown on to one of its branches and had burst out into a scrap of a song
ben weatherstaff laughed outright
what did he do that for
asked mary
hes made up his mind to make friends with thee replied ben
dang me if he hasnt took a fancy to thee
said mary and she moved toward the little tree softly and looked up
would you make friends with me
she said to the robin just as if she was speaking to a person
why he cried out tha said that as nice an human as if tha was a real child instead of a sharp old woman
tha said it almost like dickon talks to his wild things on th moor
do you know dickon
mary asked turning round rather in a hurry
everybody knows him
dickons wanderin about everywhere
th very blackberries an heatherbells knows him
i warrant th foxes shows him where their cubs lies an th skylarks doesnt hide their nests from him
mary would have liked to ask some more questions
she was almost as curious about dickon as she was about the deserted garden
but just that moment the robin who had ended his song gave a little shake of his wings spread them and flew away
he had made his visit and had other things to do
he has flown over the wall
mary cried out watching him
he has flown into the orchardhe has flown across the other wallinto the garden where there is no door
he lives there said old ben
he came out o th egg there
if hes courtin hes makin up to some young madam of a robin that lives among th old rosetrees there
rosetrees said mary
are there rosetrees
ben weatherstaff took up his spade again and began to dig
there was ten year ago he mumbled
i should like to see them said mary
where is the green door
there must be a door somewhere
ben drove his spade deep and looked as uncompanionable as he had looked when she first saw him
there was ten year ago but there isnt now he said
cried mary
there must be
none as any one can find an none as is any ones business
dont you be a meddlesome wench an poke your nose where its no cause to go
here i must go on with my work
get you gone an play you
ive no more time
and he actually stopped digging threw his spade over his shoulder and walked off without even glancing at her or saying goodby
the cry in the corridor
at first each day which passed by for mary lennox was exactly like the others
she ran only to make herself warm and she hated the wind which rushed at her face and roared and held her back as if it were some giant she could not see
tha got on well enough with that this mornin didnt tha
it tastes nice today said mary feeling a little surprised herself
its th air of th moor thats givin thee stomach for tha victuals answered martha
its lucky for thee that thas got victuals as well as appetite
theres been twelve in our cottage as had th stomach an nothin to put in it
you go on playin you out o doors every day an youll get some flesh on your bones an you wont be so yeller
i dont play said mary
i have nothing to play with
nothin to play with
exclaimed martha
our children plays with sticks and stones
they just runs about an shouts an looks at things
mary did not shout but she looked at things
there was nothing else to do
she walked round and round the gardens and wandered about the paths in the park
sometimes she looked for ben weatherstaff but though several times she saw him at work he was too busy to look at her or was too surly
once when she was walking toward him he picked up his spade and turned away as if he did it on purpose
one place she went to oftener than to any other
it was the long walk outside the gardens with the walls round them
there were bare flowerbeds on either side of it and against the walls ivy grew thickly
there was one part of the wall where the creeping dark green leaves were more bushy than elsewhere
it seemed as if for a long time that part had been neglected
the rest of it had been clipped and made to look neat but at this lower end of the walk it had not been trimmed at all
a few days after she had talked to ben weatherstaff mary stopped to notice this and wondered why it was so
she cried out is it youis it you
and it did not seem at all queer to her that she spoke to him as if she was sure that he would understand and answer her
he did answer
he twittered and chirped and hopped along the wall as if he were telling her all sorts of things
it seemed to mistress mary as if she understood him too though he was not speaking in words
it was as if he said good morning
isnt the wind nice
isnt the sun nice
isnt everything nice
let us both chirp and hop and twitter
mary began to laugh and as he hopped and took little flights along the wall she ran after him
poor little thin sallow ugly maryshe actually looked almost pretty for a moment
i like you
i like you
she cried out pattering down the walk and she chirped and tried to whistle which last she did not know how to do in the least
but the robin seemed to be quite satisfied and chirped and whistled back at her
at last he spread his wings and made a darting flight to the top of a tree where he perched and sang loudly
that reminded mary of the first time she had seen him
he had been swinging on a treetop then and she had been standing in the orchard
now she was on the other side of the orchard and standing in the path outside a wallmuch lower downand there was the same tree inside
its in the garden no one can go into she said to herself
its the garden without a door
he lives in there
how i wish i could see what it is like
she ran up the walk to the green door she had entered the first morning
it is the garden she said
i am sure it is
she walked round and looked closely at that side of the orchard wall but she only found what she had found beforethat there was no door in it
its very queer she said
ben weatherstaff said there was no door and there is no door
but there must have been one ten years ago because mr
craven buried the key
this gave her so much to think of that she began to be quite interested and feel that she was not sorry that she had come to misselthwaite
in india she had always felt hot and too languid to care much about anything
the fact was that the fresh wind from the moor had begun to blow the cobwebs out of her young brain and to waken her up a little
she stayed out of doors nearly all day and when she sat down to her supper at night she felt hungry and drowsy and comfortable
she did not feel cross when martha chattered away
she felt as if she rather liked to hear her and at last she thought she would ask her a question
she asked it after she had finished her supper and had sat down on the hearthrug before the fire
why did mr
craven hate the garden
she had made martha stay with her and martha had not objected at all
martha liked to talk and the strange child who had lived in india and been waited upon by blacks was novelty enough to attract her
she sat down on the hearth herself without waiting to be asked
art tha thinkin about that garden yet
i knew tha would
that was just the way with me when i first heard about it
why did he hate it
mary persisted
martha tucked her feet under her and made herself quite comfortable
listen to th wind wutherin round the house she said
you could bare stand up on the moor if you was out on it tonight
mary did not know what wutherin meant until she listened and then she understood
it must mean that hollow shuddering sort of roar which rushed round and round the house as if the giant no one could see were buffeting it and beating at the walls and windows to try to break in
but one knew he could not get in and somehow it made one feel very safe and warm inside a room with a red coal fire
but why did he hate it so
she asked after she had listened
she intended to know if martha did
then martha gave up her store of knowledge
mind she said mrs
medlock said its not to be talked about
theres lots o things in this place thats not to be talked over
cravens orders
his troubles are none servants business he says
but for th garden he wouldnt be like he is
it was mrs
cravens garden that she had made when first they were married an she just loved it an they used to tend the flowers themselves
an none o th gardeners was ever let to go in
him an her used to go in an shut th door an stay there hours an hours readin an talkin
an she was just a bit of a girl an there was an old tree with a branch bent like a seat on it
an she made roses grow over it an she used to sit there
but one day when she was sittin there th branch broke an she fell on th ground an was hurt so bad that next day she died
th doctors thought hed go out o his mind an die too
thats why he hates it
no ones never gone in since an he wont let any one talk about it
mary did not ask any more questions
she looked at the red fire and listened to the wind wutherin
it seemed to be wutherin louder than ever
at that moment a very good thing was happening to her
four good things had happened to her in fact since she came to misselthwaite manor
she was getting on
but as she was listening to the wind she began to listen to something else
she did not know what it was because at first she could scarcely distinguish it from the wind itself
it was a curious soundit seemed almost as if a child were crying somewhere
sometimes the wind sounded rather like a child crying but presently mistress mary felt quite sure that this sound was inside the house not outside it
it was far away but it was inside
she turned round and looked at martha
do you hear any one crying
martha suddenly looked confused
no she answered
its th wind
sometimes it sounds like as if some one was lost on th moor an wailin
its got all sorts o sounds
but listen said mary
its in the housedown one of those long corridors
i told you so
it is some one cryingand it isnt a grownup person
it was th wind said martha stubbornly
an if it wasnt it was little betty butterworth th scullerymaid
shes had th toothache all day
but something troubled and awkward in her manner made mistress mary stare very hard at her
she did not believe she was speaking the truth
chapter vi there was some one cryingthere was
the next day the rain poured down in torrents again and when mary looked out of her window the moor was almost hidden by gray mist and cloud
there could be no going out today
what do you do in your cottage when it rains like this
try to keep from under each others feet mostly martha answered
there does seem a lot of us then
mothers a goodtempered woman but she gets fair moithered
the biggest ones goes out in th cowshed and plays there
dickon he doesnt mind th wet
he goes out just th same as if th sun was shinin
he says he sees things on rainy days as doesnt show when its fair weather
he once found a little fox cub half drowned in its hole and he brought it home in th bosom of his shirt to keep it warm
its mother had been killed nearby an th hole was swum out an th rest o th litter was dead
hes got it at home now
he found a halfdrowned young crow another time an he brought it home too an tamed it
its named soot because its so black an it hops an flies about with him everywhere
the time had come when mary had forgotten to resent marthas familiar talk
she had even begun to find it interesting and to be sorry when she stopped or went away
the children seemed to tumble about and amuse themselves like a litter of rough goodnatured collie puppies
mary was most attracted by the mother and dickon
when martha told stories of what mother said or did they always sounded comfortable
if i had a raven or a fox cub i could play with it said mary
but i have nothing
martha looked perplexed
can tha knit
no answered mary
can tha sew
can tha read
then why doesnt tha read somethin or learn a bit o spellin
thast old enough to be learnin thy book a good bit now
i havent any books said mary
those i had were left in india
thats a pity said martha
medlockd let thee go into th library theres thousands o books there
mary did not ask where the library was because she was suddenly inspired by a new idea
she made up her mind to go and find it herself
she was not troubled about mrs
medlock seemed always to be in her comfortable housekeepers sittingroom downstairs
in this queer place one scarcely ever saw any one at all
medlock was out of the way
marys meals were served regularly and martha waited on her but no one troubled themselves about her in the least
medlock came and looked at her every day or two but no one inquired what she did or told her what to do
she supposed that perhaps this was the english way of treating children
in india she had always been attended by her ayah who had followed her about and waited on her hand and foot
she had often been tired of her company
now she was followed by nobody and was learning to dress herself because martha looked as though she thought she was silly and stupid when she wanted to have things handed to her and put on
hasnt tha got good sense
she said once when mary had stood waiting for her to put on her gloves for her
our susan ann is twice as sharp as thee an shes only four year old
sometimes tha looks fair soft in th head
mary had worn her contrary scowl for an hour after that but it made her think several entirely new things
she stood at the window for about ten minutes this morning after martha had swept up the hearth for the last time and gone downstairs
she was thinking over the new idea which had come to her when she heard of the library
she did not care very much about the library itself because she had read very few books but to hear of it brought back to her mind the hundred rooms with closed doors
she wondered if they were all really locked and what she would find if she could get into any of them
were there a hundred really
why shouldnt she go and see how many doors she could count
it would be something to do on this morning when she could not go out
she had never been taught to ask permission to do things and she knew nothing at all about authority so she would not have thought it necessary to ask mrs
medlock if she might walk about the house even if she had seen her
she opened the door of the room and went into the corridor and then she began her wanderings
it was a long corridor and it branched into other corridors and it led her up short flights of steps which mounted to others again
there were doors and doors and there were pictures on the walls
sometimes they were pictures of dark curious landscapes but oftenest they were portraits of men and women in queer grand costumes made of satin and velvet
she found herself in one long gallery whose walls were covered with these portraits
she had never thought there could be so many in any house
she walked slowly down this place and stared at the faces which also seemed to stare at her
she felt as if they were wondering what a little girl from india was doing in their house
she always stopped to look at the children and wonder what their names were and where they had gone and why they wore such odd clothes
there was a stiff plain little girl rather like herself
she wore a green brocade dress and held a green parrot on her finger
her eyes had a sharp curious look
where do you live now
said mary aloud to her
i wish you were here
surely no other little girl ever spent such a queer morning
since so many rooms had been built people must have lived in them but it all seemed so empty that she could not quite believe it true
it was not until she climbed to the second floor that she thought of turning the handle of a door
all the doors were shut as mrs
medlock had said they were but at last she put her hand on the handle of one of them and turned it
she was almost frightened for a moment when she felt that it turned without difficulty and that when she pushed upon the door itself it slowly and heavily opened
it was a massive door and opened into a big bedroom
there were embroidered hangings on the wall and inlaid furniture such as she had seen in india stood about the room
a broad window with leaded panes looked out upon the moor and over the mantel was another portrait of the stiff plain little girl who seemed to stare at her more curiously than ever
perhaps she slept here once said mary
she stares at me so that she makes me feel queer
after that she opened more doors and more
she saw so many rooms that she became quite tired and began to think that there must be a hundred though she had not counted them
in all of them there were old pictures or old tapestries with strange scenes worked on them
there were curious pieces of furniture and curious ornaments in nearly all of them
in one room which looked like a ladys sittingroom the hangings were all embroidered velvet and in a cabinet were about a hundred little elephants made of ivory
they were of different sizes and some had their mahouts or palanquins on their backs
some were much bigger than the others and some were so tiny that they seemed only babies
mary had seen carved ivory in india and she knew all about elephants
she opened the door of the cabinet and stood on a footstool and played with these for quite a long time
when she got tired she set the elephants in order and shut the door of the cabinet
in all her wanderings through the long corridors and the empty rooms she had seen nothing alive but in this room she saw something
just after she had closed the cabinet door she heard a tiny rustling sound
it made her jump and look around at the sofa by the fireplace from which it seemed to come
in the corner of the sofa there was a cushion and in the velvet which covered it there was a hole and out of the hole peeped a tiny head with a pair of frightened eyes in it
mary crept softly across the room to look
the bright eyes belonged to a little gray mouse and the mouse had eaten a hole into the cushion and made a comfortable nest there
six baby mice were cuddled up asleep near her
if there was no one else alive in the hundred rooms there were seven mice who did not look lonely at all
if they wouldnt be so frightened i would take them back with me said
she had wandered about long enough to feel too tired to wander any farther and she turned back
i believe i have taken a wrong turning again she said standing still at what seemed the end of a short passage with tapestry on the wall
i dont know which way to go
how still everything is
it was while she was standing here and just after she had said this that the stillness was broken by a sound
it was another cry but not quite like the one she had heard last night it was only a short one a fretful childish whine muffled by passing through walls
its nearer than it was said mary her heart beating rather faster
and it is crying
she put her hand accidentally upon the tapestry near her and then sprang back feeling quite startled
the tapestry was the covering of a door which fell open and showed her that there was another part of the corridor behind it and mrs
medlock was coming up it with her bunch of keys in her hand and a very cross look on her face
what are you doing here
she said and she took mary by the arm and pulled her away
what did i tell you
i turned round the wrong corner explained mary
i didnt know which way to go and i heard some one crying
she quite hated mrs
medlock at the moment but she hated her more the next
you didnt hear anything of the sort said the housekeeper
you come along back to your own nursery or ill box your ears
and she took her by the arm and half pushed half pulled her up one passage and down another until she pushed her in at the door of her own room
now she said you stay where youre told to stay or youll find yourself locked up
the master had better get you a governess same as he said he would
youre one that needs some one to look sharp after you
ive got enough to do
she went out of the room and slammed the door after her and mary went and sat on the hearthrug pale with rage
she did not cry but ground her teeth
there was some one cryingthere wasthere was
she said to herself
she had heard it twice now and sometime she would find out
she had found out a great deal this morning
chapter vii
the key of the garden
two days after this when mary opened her eyes she sat upright in bed immediately and called to martha
look at the moor
look at the moor
the rainstorm had ended and the gray mist and clouds had been swept away in the night by the wind
the wind itself had ceased and a brilliant deep blue sky arched high over the moorland
never never had
mary dreamed of a sky so blue
the farreaching world of the moor itself looked softly blue instead of gloomy purpleblack or awful dreary gray
aye said martha with a cheerful grin
th storms over for a bit
it does like this at this time o th year
it goes off in a night like it was pretendin it had never been here an never meant to come again
thats because th springtimes on its way
its a long way off yet but its comin
i thought perhaps it always rained or looked dark in england mary said
said martha sitting up on her heels among her black lead brushes
nowt o th soart
what does that mean
asked mary seriously
in india the natives spoke different dialects which only a few people understood so she was not surprised when martha used words she did not know
martha laughed as she had done the first morning
there now she said
ive talked broad yorkshire again like mrs
medlock said i mustnt
nowt o th soart means nothinofthesort slowly and carefully but it takes so long to say it
yorkshires th sunniest place on earth when it is sunny
i told thee thad like th moor after a bit
youll want to get out on it at sunrise an live out on it all day like dickon does
could i ever get there
asked mary wistfully looking through her window at the faroff blue
it was so new and big and wonderful and such a heavenly color
i dont know answered martha
thas never used tha legs since tha was born it seems to me
tha couldnt walk five mile
its five mile to our cottage
i should like to see your cottage
martha stared at her a moment curiously before she took up her polishing brush and began to rub the grate again
she was thinking that the small plain face did not look quite as sour at this moment as it had done the first morning she saw it
it looked just a trifle like little susan
anns when she wanted something very much
ill ask my mother about it she said
shes one o them that nearly always sees a way to do things
its my day out today an im goin home
medlock thinks a lot o mother
perhaps she could talk to her
i like your mother said mary
i should think tha did agreed martha polishing away
ive never seen her said mary
no tha hasnt replied martha
she sat up on her heels again and rubbed the end of her nose with the back of her hand as if puzzled for a moment but she ended quite positively
well shes that sensible an hard workin an goodnatured an clean that no one could help likin her whether theyd seen her or not
im goin home to her on my day out i just jump for joy when im crossin th moor
i like dickon added mary
and ive never seen him
well said martha stoutly ive told thee that th very birds likes him an th rabbits an wild sheep an ponies an th foxes themselves
i wonder staring at her reflectively what dickon would think of thee
he wouldnt like me said mary in her stiff cold little way
no one does
martha looked reflective again
how does tha like thysel
she inquired really quite as if she were curious to know
mary hesitated a moment and thought it over
not at allreally she answered
but i never thought of that before
martha grinned a little as if at some homely recollection
mother said that to me once she said
she was at her washtub an i was in a bad temper an talkin ill of folk an she turns round on me an says tha young vixon tha
there tha stands sayin tha doesnt like this one an tha doesnt like that one
how does tha like thysel
it made me laugh an it brought me to my senses in a minute
she went away in high spirits as soon as she had given mary her breakfast
she was going to walk five miles across the moor to the cottage and she was going to help her mother with the washing and do the weeks baking and enjoy herself thoroughly
mary felt lonelier than ever when she knew she was no longer in the house
she went out into the garden as quickly as possible and the first thing she did was to run round and round the fountain flower garden ten times
she counted the times carefully and when she had finished she felt in better spirits
the sunshine made the whole place look different
she went into the first kitchengarden and found ben weatherstaff working there with two other gardeners
the change in the weather seemed to have done him good
he spoke to her of his own accord
springtimes comin he said
cannot tha smell it
mary sniffed and thought she could
i smell something nice and fresh and damp she said
thats th good rich earth he answered digging away
its in a good humor makin ready to grow things
its glad when plantin time comes
its dull in th winter when its got nowt to do
in th flower gardens out there things will be stirrin down below in th dark
th suns warmin em
youll see bits o green spikes stickin out o th black earth after a bit
what will they be
asked mary
crocuses an snowdrops an daffydowndillys
has tha never seen them
everything is hot and wet and green after the rains in india said mary
and i think things grow up in a night
these wont grow up in a night said weatherstaff
thall have to wait for em
theyll poke up a bit higher here an push out a spike more there an uncurl a leaf this day an another that
you watch em
i am going to answered mary
very soon she heard the soft rustling flight of wings again and she knew at once that the robin had come again
he was very pert and lively and hopped about so close to her feet and put his head on one side and looked at her so slyly that she asked ben weatherstaff a question
do you think he remembers me
remembers thee
said weatherstaff indignantly
he knows every cabbage stump in th gardens let alone th people
hes never seen a little wench here before an hes bent on findin out all about thee
thas no need to try to hide anything from him
are things stirring down below in the dark in that garden where he lives
mary inquired
what garden
grunted weatherstaff becoming surly again
the one where the old rosetrees are
she could not help asking because she wanted so much to know
are all the flowers dead or do some of them come again in the summer
are there ever any roses
ask him said ben weatherstaff hunching his shoulders toward the robin
hes the only one as knows
no one else has seen inside it for ten year
ten years was a long time mary thought
she had been born ten years ago
she walked away slowly thinking
she had begun to like the garden just as she had begun to like the robin and dickon and marthas mother
she was beginning to like martha too
that seemed a good many people to likewhen you were not used to liking
she thought of the robin as one of the people
but she knew he had followed her and the surprise so filled her with delight that she almost trembled a little
you do remember me
she cried out
you are prettier than anything else in the world
she chirped and talked and coaxed and he hopped and flirted his tail and twittered
it was as if he were talking
mistress mary forgot that she had ever been contrary in her life when he allowed her to draw closer and closer to him and bend down and talk and try to make something like robin sounds
to think that he should actually let her come as near to him as that
he knew nothing in the world would make her put out her hand toward him or startle him in the least tiniest way
he knew it because he was a real persononly nicer than any other person in the world
she was so happy that she scarcely dared to breathe
the flowerbed was not quite bare
he stopped on it to look for a worm
the earth had been turned up because a dog had been trying to dig up a mole and he had scratched quite a deep hole
mary looked at it not really knowing why the hole was there and as she looked she saw something almost buried in the newlyturned soil
it was something like a ring of rusty iron or brass and when the robin flew up into a tree nearby she put out her hand and picked the ring up
it was more than a ring however it was an old key which looked as if it had been buried a long time
mistress mary stood up and looked at it with an almost frightened face as it hung from her finger
perhaps it has been buried for ten years she said in a whisper
perhaps it is the key to the garden
chapter viii
the robin who showed the way
she looked at the key quite a long time
she turned it over and over and thought about it
as i have said before she was not a child who had been trained to ask permission or consult her elders about things
it was because it had been shut up so long that she wanted to see it
it seemed as if it must be different from other places and that something strange must have happened to it during ten years
the thought of that pleased her very much
there is no doubt that the fresh strong pure air from the moor had a great deal to do with it
just as it had given her an appetite and fighting with the wind had stirred her blood so the same things had stirred her mind
in india she had always been too hot and languid and weak to care much about anything but in this place she was beginning to care and to want to do new things
already she felt less contrary though she did not know why
she put the key in her pocket and walked up and down her walk
no one but herself ever seemed to come there so she could walk slowly and look at the wall or rather at the ivy growing on it
the ivy was the baffling thing
howsoever carefully she looked she could see nothing but thicklygrowing glossy dark green leaves
she was very much disappointed
something of her contrariness came back to her as she paced the walk and looked over it at the treetops inside
it seemed so silly she said to herself to be near it and not be able to get in
medlock had allowed martha to sleep all night at the cottage but she was back at her work in the morning with cheeks redder than ever and in the best of spirits
i got up at four oclock she said
it was pretty on th moor with th birds gettin up an th rabbits scamperin about an th sun risin
i didnt walk all th way
a man gave me a ride in his cart an
i can tell you i did enjoy myself
she was full of stories of the delights of her day out
her mother had been glad to see her and they had got the baking and washing all out of the way
she had even made each of the children a doughcake with a bit of brown sugar in it
i had em all pipin hot when they came in from playin on th moor
an th cottage all smelt o nice clean hot bakin an there was a good fire an they just shouted for joy
our dickon he said our cottage was good enough for a king to live in
they did like to hear about you said martha
they wanted to know all about th blacks an about th ship you came in
i couldnt tell em enough
mary reflected a little
ill tell you a great deal more before your next day out she said so that you will have more to talk about
i dare say they would like to hear about riding on elephants and camels and about the officers going to hunt tigers
cried delighted martha
it would set em clean off their heads
would tha really do that miss
it would be same as a wild beast show like we heard they had in york once
india is quite different from yorkshire mary said slowly as she thought the matter over
i never thought of that
did dickon and your mother like to hear you talk about me
why our dickons eyes nearly started out o his head they got that round answered martha
but mother she was put out about your seemin to be all by yourself like
she said hasnt mr
craven got no governess for her nor no nurse
and i said no he hasnt though
medlock says he will when he thinks of it but she says he maynt think of it for two or three years
i dont want a governess said mary sharply
you do your best to cheer her up she says an i said i would
mary gave her a long steady look
you do cheer me up she said
i like to hear you talk
presently martha went out of the room and came back with something held in her hands under her apron
what does tha think she said with a cheerful grin
ive brought thee a present
exclaimed mistress mary
how could a cottage full of fourteen hungry people give any one a present
a man was drivin across the moor peddlin martha explained
an he stopped his cart at our door
he had pots an pans an odds an ends but mother had no money to buy anythin
just as he was goin away our lizabeth ellen called out mother hes got skippinropes with red an blue handles
an mother she calls out quite sudden here stop mister
how much are they
she brought it out from under her apron and exhibited it quite proudly
it was a strong slender rope with a striped red and blue handle at each end but mary lennox had never seen a skippingrope before
she gazed at it with a mystified expression
what is it for
she asked curiously
cried out martha
does tha mean that theyve not got skippinropes in india for all theyve got elephants and tigers and camels
no wonder most of ems black
this is what its for just watch me
but martha did not even see them
the interest and curiosity in mistress marys face delighted her and she went on skipping and counted as she skipped until she had reached a hundred
i could skip longer than that she said when she stopped
ive skipped as much as five hundred when i was twelve but i wasnt as fat then as i am now an i was in practice
mary got up from her chair beginning to feel excited herself
it looks nice she said
your mother is a kind woman
do you think i could ever skip like that
you just try it urged martha handing her the skippingrope
you cant skip a hundred at first but if you practise youll mount up
thats what mother said
she says nothin will do her more good than skippin rope
its th sensiblest toy a child can have
let her play out in th fresh air skippin an itll stretch her legs an arms an give her some strength in em
it was plain that there was not a great deal of strength in mistress
marys arms and legs when she first began to skip
she was not very clever at it but she liked it so much that she did not want to stop
put on tha things and run an skip out o doors said martha
mother said i must tell you to keep out o doors as much as you could even when it rains a bit so as tha wrap up warm
mary put on her coat and hat and took her skippingrope over her arm
she opened the door to go out and then suddenly thought of something and turned back rather slowly
martha she said they were your wages
it was your twopence really
she said it stiffly because she was not used to thanking people or noticing that they did things for her
thank you she said and held out her hand because she did not know what else to do
martha gave her hand a clumsy little shake as if she was not accustomed to this sort of thing either
then she laughed
tha art a queer oldwomanish thing she said
if thad been our lizabeth ellen thad have give me a kiss
mary looked stiffer than ever
do you want me to kiss you
martha laughed again
nay not me she answered
if tha was different praps thad want to thysel
but tha isnt
run off outside an play with thy rope
mistress mary felt a little awkward as she went out of the room
yorkshire people seemed strange and martha was always rather a puzzle to her
at first she had disliked her very much but now she did not
the skippingrope was a wonderful thing
she counted and skipped and skipped and counted until her cheeks were quite red and she was more interested than she had ever been since she was born
the sun was shining and a little wind was blowingnot a rough wind but one which came in delightful little gusts and brought a fresh scent of newly turned earth with it
she skipped round the fountain garden and up one walk and down another
she skipped at last into the kitchengarden and saw ben weatherstaff digging and talking to his robin which was hopping about him
she skipped down the walk toward him and he lifted his head and looked at her with a curious expression
she had wondered if he would notice her
she really wanted him to see her skip
he exclaimed
upon my word
praps tha art a young un after all an praps thas got childs blood in thy veins instead of sour buttermilk
thas skipped red into thy cheeks as sure as my names ben
weatherstaff
i wouldnt have believed tha could do it
i never skipped before mary said
im just beginning
i can only go up to twenty
tha keep on said ben
tha shapes well enough at it for a young un thats lived with heathen
just see how hes watchin thee jerking his head toward the robin
he followed after thee yesterday
hell be at it again today
hell be bound to find out what th skippinrope is
hes never seen one
shaking his head at the bird tha curosity will be th death of thee sometime if tha doesnt look sharp
mary skipped round all the gardens and round the orchard resting every few minutes
at length she went to her own special walk and made up her mind to try if she could skip the whole length of it
it was a good long skip and she began slowly but before she had gone halfway down the path she was so hot and breathless that she was obliged to stop
she did not mind much because she had already counted up to thirty
she stopped with a little laugh of pleasure and there lo and behold was the robin swaying on a long branch of ivy
he had followed her and he greeted her with a chirp
as mary had skipped toward him she felt something heavy in her pocket strike against her at each jump and when she saw the robin she laughed again
you showed me where the key was yesterday she said
you ought to show me the door today but i dont believe you know
the robin flew from his swinging spray of ivy on to the top of the wall and he opened his beak and sang a loud lovely trill merely to show off
nothing in the world is quite as adorably lovely as a robin when he shows offand they are nearly always doing it
mary lennox had heard a great deal about magic in her ayahs stories and she always said that what happened almost at that moment was magic
one of the nice little gusts of wind rushed down the walk and it was a stronger one than the rest
it was strong enough to wave the branches of the trees and it was more than strong enough to sway the trailing sprays of untrimmed ivy hanging from the wall
mary had stepped close to the robin and suddenly the gust of wind swung aside some loose ivy trails and more suddenly still she jumped toward it and caught it in her hand
this she did because she had seen something under ita round knob which had been covered by the leaves hanging over it
it was the knob of a door
she put her hands under the leaves and began to pull and push them aside
thick as the ivy hung it nearly all was a loose and swinging curtain though some had crept over wood and iron
marys heart began to thump and her hands to shake a little in her delight and excitement
the robin kept singing and twittering away and tilting his head on one side as if he were as excited as she was
what was this under her hands which was square and made of iron and which her fingers found a hole in
it was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years and she put her hand in her pocket drew out the key and found it fitted the keyhole
she put the key in and turned it
it took two hands to do it but it did turn
and then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long walk to see if any one was coming
no one was coming
no one ever did come it seemed and she took another long breath because she could not help it and she held back the swinging curtain of ivy and pushed back the door which opened slowlyslowly
then she slipped through it and shut it behind her and stood with her back against it looking about her and breathing quite fast with excitement and wonder and delight
she was standing inside the secret garden
chapter ix
the strangest house any one ever lived in
it was the sweetest most mysteriouslooking place any one could imagine
the high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of climbing roses which were so thick that they were matted together
mary lennox knew they were roses because she had seen a great many roses in india
all the ground was covered with grass of a wintry brown and out of it grew clumps of bushes which were surely rosebushes if they were alive
there were numbers of standard roses which had so spread their branches that they were like little trees
it was this hazy tangle from tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious
mary had thought it must be different from other gardens which had not been left all by themselves so long and indeed it was different from any other place she had ever seen in her life
how still it is
she whispered
then she waited a moment and listened at the stillness
the robin who had flown to his treetop was still as all the rest
he did not even flutter his wings he sat without stirring and looked at mary
no wonder it is still she whispered again
i am the first person who has spoken in here for ten years
she moved away from the door stepping as softly as if she were afraid of awakening some one
she was glad that there was grass under her feet and that her steps made no sounds
she walked under one of the fairylike gray arches between the trees and looked up at the sprays and tendrils which formed them
i wonder if they are all quite dead she said
is it all a quite dead garden
i wish it wasnt
but she was inside the wonderful garden and she could come through the door under the ivy any time and she felt as if she had found a world all her own
the sun was shining inside the four walls and the high arch of blue sky over this particular piece of misselthwaite seemed even more brilliant and soft than it was over the moor
the robin flew down from his treetop and hopped about or flew after her from one bush to another
he chirped a good deal and had a very busy air as if he were showing her things
everything was strange and silent and she seemed to be hundreds of miles away from any one but somehow she did not feel lonely at all
all that troubled her was her wish that she knew whether all the roses were dead or if perhaps some of them had lived and might put out leaves and buds as the weather got warmer
she did not want it to be a quite dead garden
if it were a quite alive garden how wonderful it would be and what thousands of roses would grow on every side
her skippingrope had hung over her arm when she came in and after she had walked about for a while she thought she would skip round the whole garden stopping when she wanted to look at things
there seemed to have been grass paths here and there and in one or two corners there were alcoves of evergreen with stone seats or tall mosscovered flower urns in them
as she came near the second of these alcoves she stopped skipping
there had once been a flowerbed in it and she thought she saw something sticking out of the black earthsome sharp little pale green points
she remembered what ben weatherstaff had said and she knelt down to look at them
yes they are tiny growing things and they might be crocuses or snowdrops or daffodils she whispered
she bent very close to them and sniffed the fresh scent of the damp earth
she liked it very much
perhaps there are some other ones coming up in other places she said
i will go all over the garden and look
she did not skip but walked
she went slowly and kept her eyes on the ground
she looked in the old border beds and among the grass and after she had gone round trying to miss nothing she had found ever so many more sharp pale green points and she had become quite excited again
it isnt a quite dead garden she cried out softly to herself
even if the roses are dead there are other things alive
she searched about until she found a rather sharp piece of wood and knelt down and dug and weeded out the weeds and grass until she made nice little clear places around them
now they look as if they could breathe she said after she had finished with the first ones
i am going to do ever so many more
ill do all i can see
if i havent time today i can come tomorrow
she went from place to place and dug and weeded and enjoyed herself so immensely that she was led on from bed to bed and into the grass under the trees
the exercise made her so warm that she first threw her coat off and then her hat and without knowing it she was smiling down on to the grass and the pale green points all the time
the robin was tremendously busy
he was very much pleased to see gardening begun on his own estate
he had often wondered at ben
weatherstaff
where gardening is done all sorts of delightful things to eat are turned up with the soil
now here was this new kind of creature who was not half bens size and yet had had the sense to come into his garden and begin at once
mistress mary worked in her garden until it was time to go to her midday dinner
in fact she was rather late in remembering and when she put on her coat and hat and picked up her skippingrope she could not believe that she had been working two or three hours
i shall come back this afternoon she said looking all round at her new kingdom and speaking to the trees and the rosebushes as if they heard her
then she ran lightly across the grass pushed open the slow old door and slipped through it under the ivy
she had such red cheeks and such bright eyes and ate such a dinner that martha was delighted
two pieces o meat an two helps o rice puddin
mother will be pleased when i tell her what th skippinropes done for thee
in the course of her digging with her pointed stick mistress mary had found herself digging up a sort of white root rather like an onion
she had put it back in its place and patted the earth carefully down on it and just now she wondered if martha could tell her what it was
martha she said what are those white roots that look like onions
theyre bulbs answered martha
lots o spring flowers grow from em
th very little ones are snowdrops an crocuses an th big ones are narcissusis an jonquils an daffydowndillys
th biggest of all is lilies an purple flags
they are nice
dickons got a whole lot of em planted in our bit o garden
does dickon know all about them
asked mary a new idea taking possession of her
our dickon can make a flower grow out of a brick walk
mother says he just whispers things out o th ground
do bulbs live a long time
would they live years and years if no one helped them
inquired mary anxiously
theyre things as helps themselves said martha
thats why poor folk can afford to have em
if you dont trouble em most of emll work away underground for a lifetime an spread out an have little uns
theres a place in th park woods here where theres snowdrops by thousands
theyre the prettiest sight in yorkshire when th spring comes
no one knows when they was first planted
i wish the spring was here now said mary
i want to see all the things that grow in england
she had finished her dinner and gone to her favorite seat on the hearthrug
i wishi wish i had a little spade she said
whatever does tha want a spade for
asked martha laughing
art tha goin to take to diggin
i must tell mother that too
mary looked at the fire and pondered a little
she must be careful if she meant to keep her secret kingdom
she wasnt doing any harm but if
craven found out about the open door he would be fearfully angry and get a new key and lock it up forevermore
she really could not bear that
this is such a big lonely place she said slowly as if she were turning matters over in her mind
the house is lonely and the park is lonely and the gardens are lonely
so many places seem shut up
i never did many things in india but there were more people to look atnatives and soldiers marching byand sometimes bands playing and my ayah told me stories
there is no one to talk to here except you and ben
weatherstaff
and you have to do your work and ben weatherstaff wont speak to me often
i thought if i had a little spade i could dig somewhere as he does and i might make a little garden if he would give me some seeds
marthas face quite lighted up
she exclaimed if that wasnt one of th things mother said
she says theres such a lot o room in that big place why dont they give her a bit for herself even if she doesnt plant nothin but parsley an radishes
shed dig an rake away an be right down happy over it
them was the very words she said
how many things she knows doesnt she
said martha
its like she says a woman as brings up twelve children learns something besides her a b c
childrens as good as rithmetic to set you findin out things
how much would a spade costa little one
mary asked
well was marthas reflective answer at thwaite village theres a shop or so an i saw little garden sets with a spade an a rake an a fork all tied together for two shillings
an they was stout enough to work with too
ive got more than that in my purse said mary
morrison gave me five shillings and mrs
medlock gave me some money from mr
did he remember thee that much
exclaimed martha
medlock said i was to have a shilling a week to spend
she gives me one every saturday
i didnt know what to spend it on
thats riches said martha
tha can buy anything in th world tha wants
th rent of our cottage is only one an threepence an its like pullin eyeteeth to get it
now ive just thought of somethin putting her hands on her hips
said mary eagerly
in the shop at thwaite they sell packages o flowerseeds for a penny each and our dickon he knows which is th prettiest ones an how to make em grow
he walks over to thwaite many a day just for th fun of it
does tha know how to print letters
i know how to write mary answered
martha shook her head
our dickon can only read printin
if tha could print we could write a letter to him an ask him to go an buy th garden tools an th seeds at th same time
youre a good girl
mary cried
you are really
i didnt know you were so nice
i know i can print letters if i try
lets ask mrs
medlock for a pen and ink and some paper
ive got some of my own said martha
i bought em so i could print a bit of a letter to mother of a sunday
ill go and get it
she ran out of the room and mary stood by the fire and twisted her thin little hands together with sheer pleasure
if i have a spade she whispered i can make the earth nice and soft and dig up weeds
if i have seeds and can make flowers grow the garden wont be dead at allit will come alive
medlock was there and told her to do something so mary waited for what seemed to her a long time before she came back
then it was a serious piece of work to write to dickon
mary had been taught very little because her governesses had disliked her too much to stay with her
she could not spell particularly well but she found that she could print letters when she tried
this was the letter martha dictated to her my dear dickon this comes hoping to find you well as it leaves me at present
miss mary has plenty of money and will you go to thwaite and buy her some flower seeds and a set of garden tools to make a flowerbed
pick the prettiest ones and easy to grow because she has never done it before and lived in india which is different
give my love to mother and every one of you
miss mary is going to tell me a lot more so that on my next day out you can hear about elephants and camels and gentlemen going hunting lions and tigers
your loving sister martha phoebe sowerby
well put the money in th envelope an ill get th butchers boy to take it in his cart
hes a great friend o dickons said martha
how shall i get the things when dickon buys them
asked mary
hell bring em to you himself
hell like to walk over this way
exclaimed mary then i shall see him
i never thought i should see dickon
does tha want to see him
asked martha suddenly she had looked so pleased
i never saw a boy foxes and crows loved
i want to see him very much
martha gave a little start as if she suddenly remembered something
now to think she broke out to think o me forgettin that there an i thought i was goin to tell you first thing this mornin
i asked motherand she said shed ask mrs
medlock her own self
do you mean mary began
what i said tuesday
ask her if you might be driven over to our cottage some day and have a bit o mothers hot oat cake an butter an a glass o milk
it seemed as if all the interesting things were happening in one day
to think of going over the moor in the daylight and when the sky was blue
to think of going into the cottage which held twelve children
does she think mrs
medlock would let me go
she asked quite anxiously
aye she thinks she would
she knows what a tidy woman mother is and how clean she keeps the cottage
if i went i should see your mother as well as dickon said mary thinking it over and liking the idea very much
she doesnt seem to be like the mothers in india
her work in the garden and the excitement of the afternoon ended by making her feel quiet and thoughtful
martha stayed with her until teatime but they sat in comfortable quiet and talked very little
but just before martha went downstairs for the teatray mary asked a question
martha she said has the scullerymaid had the toothache again today
martha certainly started slightly
what makes thee ask that
because when i waited so long for you to come back i opened the door and walked down the corridor to see if you were coming
and i heard that faroff crying again just as we heard it the other night
there isnt a wind today so you see it couldnt have been the wind
said martha restlessly
tha mustnt go walkin about in corridors an listenin
craven would be that there angry theres no knowin what hed do
i wasnt listening said mary
i was just waiting for youand i heard it
thats three times
theres mrs
medlocks bell said martha and she almost ran out of the room
its the strangest house any one ever lived in said mary drowsily as she dropped her head on the cushioned seat of the armchair near her
fresh air and digging and skippingrope had made her feel so comfortably tired that she fell asleep
the sun shone down for nearly a week on the secret garden
the secret
garden was what mary called it when she was thinking of it
she liked the name and she liked still more the feeling that when its beautiful old walls shut her in no one knew where she was
it seemed almost like being shut out of the world in some fairy place
the few books she had read and liked had been fairystory books and she had read of secret gardens in some of the stories
sometimes people went to sleep in them for a hundred years which she had thought must be rather stupid
she had no intention of going to sleep and in fact she was becoming wider awake every day which passed at misselthwaite
she was beginning to like to be out of doors she no longer hated the wind but enjoyed it
she could run faster and longer and she could skip up to a hundred
the bulbs in the secret garden must have been much astonished
such nice clear places were made round them that they had all the breathing space they wanted and really if mistress mary had known it they began to cheer up under the dark earth and work tremendously
the sun could get at them and warm them and when the rain came down it could reach them at once so they began to feel very much alive
mary was an odd determined little person and now she had something interesting to be determined about she was very much absorbed indeed
she worked and dug and pulled up weeds steadily only becoming more pleased with her work every hour instead of tiring of it
it seemed to her like a fascinating sort of play
she found many more of the sprouting pale green points than she had ever hoped to find
they seemed to be starting up everywhere and each day she was sure she found tiny new ones some so tiny that they barely peeped above the earth
there were so many that she remembered what martha had said about the snowdrops by the thousands and about bulbs spreading and making new ones
these had been left to themselves for ten years and perhaps they had spread like the snowdrops into thousands
she wondered how long it would be before they showed that they were flowers
sometimes she stopped digging to look at the garden and try to imagine what it would be like when it was covered with thousands of lovely things in bloom
during that week of sunshine she became more intimate with ben
weatherstaff
she surprised him several times by seeming to start up beside him as if she sprang out of the earth
the truth was that she was afraid that he would pick up his tools and go away if he saw her coming so she always walked toward him as silently as possible
but in fact he did not object to her as strongly as he had at first
perhaps he was secretly rather flattered by her evident desire for his elderly company
then also she was more civil than she had been
thart like th robin he said to her one morning when he lifted his head and saw her standing by him
i never knows when i shall see thee or which side thall come from
hes friends with me now said mary
thats like him snapped ben weatherstaff
makin up to th women folk just for vanity an flightiness
theres nothin he wouldnt do for th sake o showin off an flirtin his tailfeathers
hes as full o pride as an eggs full o meat
he very seldom talked much and sometimes did not even answer marys questions except by a grunt but this morning he said more than usual
he stood up and rested one hobnailed boot on the top of his spade while he looked her over
how long has tha been here
he jerked out
i think its about a month she answered
thas beginnin to do misselthwaite credit he said
thas a bit fatter than tha was an thas not quite so yeller
tha looked like a young plucked crow when tha first came into this garden
thinks i to myself i never set eyes on an uglier sourer faced young un
mary was not vain and as she had never thought much of her looks she was not greatly disturbed
i know im fatter she said
my stockings are getting tighter
they used to make wrinkles
theres the robin ben weatherstaff
there indeed was the robin and she thought he looked nicer than ever
his red waistcoat was as glossy as satin and he flirted his wings and tail and tilted his head and hopped about with all sorts of lively graces
he seemed determined to make ben weatherstaff admire him
ben was sarcastic
aye there tha art
tha can put up with me for a bit sometimes when thas got no one better
thas been reddinin up thy waistcoat an polishin thy feathers this two weeks
i know what thas up to
thas courtin some bold young madam somewhere tellin thy lies to her about bein th finest cock robin on missel moor an ready to fight all th rest of em
look at him
exclaimed mary
the robin was evidently in a fascinating bold mood
he hopped closer and closer and looked at ben weatherstaff more and more engagingly
he flew on to the nearest currant bush and tilted his head and sang a little song right at him
tha thinks thall get over me by doin that said ben wrinkling his face up in such a way that mary felt sure he was trying not to look pleased
tha thinks no one can stand out against theethats what tha thinks
the robin spread his wingsmary could scarcely believe her eyes
he flew right up to the handle of ben weatherstaffs spade and alighted on the top of it
then the old mans face wrinkled itself slowly into a new expression
he stood still as if he were afraid to breatheas if he would not have stirred for the world lest his robin should start away
he spoke quite in a whisper
well im danged
he said as softly as if he were saying something quite different
tha does know how to get at a chaptha does
thas fair unearthly thas so knowin
and he stood without stirringalmost without drawing his breathuntil the robin gave another flirt to his wings and flew away
then he stood looking at the handle of the spade as if there might be magic in it and then he began to dig again and said nothing for several minutes
but because he kept breaking into a slow grin now and then mary was not afraid to talk to him
have you a garden of your own
im bachelder an lodge with martin at th gate
if you had one said mary what would you plant
cabbages an taters an onions
but if you wanted to make a flower garden persisted mary what would you plant
bulbs an sweetsmellin thingsbut mostly roses
marys face lighted up
do you like roses
ben weatherstaff rooted up a weed and threw it aside before he answered
well yes i do
i was learned that by a young lady i was gardener to
she had a lot in a place she was fond of an she loved em like they was childrenor robins
ive seen her bend over an kiss em
he dragged out another weed and scowled at it
that were as much as ten year ago
where is she now
asked mary much interested
heaven he answered and drove his spade deep into the soil cording to what parson says
what happened to the roses
mary asked again more interested than ever
they was left to themselves
mary was becoming quite excited
did they quite die
do roses quite die when they are left to themselves
she ventured
well id got to like eman i liked heran she liked em ben
weatherstaff admitted reluctantly
once or twice a year id go an work at em a bitprune em an dig about th roots
they run wild but they was in rich soil so some of em lived
when they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry how can you tell whether they are dead or alive
inquired mary
wait till th spring gets at emwait till th sun shines on th rain an th rain falls on th sunshine an then thall find out
cried mary forgetting to be careful
look along th twigs an branches an if tha sees a bit of a brown lump swelling here an there watch it after th warm rain an see what happens
he stopped suddenly and looked curiously at her eager face
why does tha care so much about roses an such all of a sudden
he demanded
mistress mary felt her face grow red
she was almost afraid to answer
ii want to play thatthat i have a garden of my own she stammered
ithere is nothing for me to do
i have nothingand no one
well said ben weatherstaff slowly as he watched her thats true
he said it in such an odd way that mary wondered if he was actually a little sorry for her
she had never felt sorry for herself she had only felt tired and cross because she disliked people and things so much
but now the world seemed to be changing and getting nicer
if no one found out about the secret garden she should enjoy herself always
she stayed with him for ten or fifteen minutes longer and asked him as many questions as she dared
he answered every one of them in his queer grunting way and he did not seem really cross and did not pick up his spade and leave her
he said something about roses just as she was going away and it reminded her of the ones he had said he had been fond of
do you go and see those other roses now
not been this year
my rheumatics has made me too stiff in th joints
he said it in his grumbling voice and then quite suddenly he seemed to get angry with her though she did not see why he should
now look here
he said sharply
dont tha ask so many questions
thart th worst wench for askin questions ive ever come across
get thee gone an play thee
ive done talkin for today
