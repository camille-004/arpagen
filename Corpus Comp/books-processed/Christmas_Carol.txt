marleys ghost
marley was dead to begin with
there is no doubt whatever about that
the register of his burial was signed by the clergyman the clerk the undertaker and the chief mourner
scrooge signed it
and scrooges name was good upon change for anything he chose to put his hand to
marley was as dead as a doornail
i dont mean to say that i know of my own knowledge what there is particularly dead about a doornail
i might have been inclined myself to regard a coffinnail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade
but the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it or the countrys done for
you will therefore permit me to repeat emphatically that marley was as dead as a doornail
scrooge knew he was dead
of course he did
how could it be otherwise
scrooge and he were partners for i dont know how many years
scrooge was his sole executor his sole administrator his sole assign his sole residuary legatee his sole friend and sole mourner
and even scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain
the mention of marleys funeral brings me back to the point i started from
there is no doubt that marley was dead
this must be distinctly understood or nothing wonderful can come of the story i am going to relate
pauls churchyard for instanceliterally to astonish his sons weak mind
scrooge never painted out old marleys name
there it stood years afterwards above the warehouse door scrooge and marley
the firm was known as scrooge and marley
sometimes people new to the business called
scrooge scrooge and sometimes marley but he answered to both names
it was all the same to him
but he was a tightfisted hand at the grindstone scrooge
a squeezing wrenching grasping scraping clutching covetous old sinner
hard and sharp as flint from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire secret and selfcontained and solitary as an oyster
the cold within him froze his old features nipped his pointed nose shrivelled his cheek stiffened his gait made his eyes red his thin lips blue and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice
a frosty rime was on his head and on his eyebrows and his wiry chin
he carried his own low temperature always about with him he iced his office in the dogdays and didnt thaw it one degree at christmas
external heat and cold had little influence on scrooge
no warmth could warm no wintry weather chill him
no wind that blew was bitterer than he no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose no pelting rain less open to entreaty
foul weather didnt know where to have him
the heaviest rain and snow and hail and sleet could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect
they often came down handsomely and scrooge never did
nobody ever stopped him in the street to say with gladsome looks my dear scrooge how are you
when will you come to see me
no beggars implored him to bestow a trifle no children asked him what it was oclock no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place of scrooge
but what did scrooge care
it was the very thing he liked
to edge his way along the crowded paths of life warning all human sympathy to keep its distance was what the knowing ones call nuts to scrooge
once upon a timeof all the good days in the year on christmas
eveold scrooge sat busy in his countinghouse
the fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole and was so dense without that although the court was of the narrowest the houses opposite were mere phantoms
to see the dingy cloud come drooping down obscuring everything one might have thought that nature lived hard by and was brewing on a large scale
the door of scrooges countinghouse was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk who in a dismal little cell beyond a sort of tank was copying letters
scrooge had a very small fire but the clerks fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal
but he couldnt replenish it for scrooge kept the coalbox in his own room and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part
wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter and tried to warm himself at the candle in which effort not being a man of strong imagination he failed
a merry christmas uncle
god save you
cried a cheerful voice
it was the voice of scrooges nephew who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach
said scrooge
he had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost this nephew of scrooges that he was all in a glow his face was ruddy and handsome his eyes sparkled and his breath smoked again
christmas a humbug uncle
said scrooges nephew
you dont mean that i am sure
i do said scrooge
merry christmas
what right have you to be merry
what reason have you to be merry
youre poor enough
come then returned the nephew gaily
what right have you to be dismal
what reason have you to be morose
youre rich enough
scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment said bah
again and followed it up with humbug
dont be cross uncle
said the nephew
what else can i be returned the uncle when i live in such a world of fools as this
merry christmas
out upon merry christmas
if i could work my will said
scrooge indignantly every idiot who goes about with merry christmas on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart
pleaded the nephew
returned the uncle sternly keep christmas in your own way and let me keep it in mine
repeated scrooges nephew
but you dont keep it
let me leave it alone then said scrooge
much good may it do you
much good it has ever done you
there are many things from which i might have derived good by which i have not profited i dare say returned the nephew christmas among the rest
and therefore uncle though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket i believe that it has done me good and will do me good and i say god bless it
the clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded
becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety he poked the fire and extinguished the last frail spark for ever
let me hear another sound from you said scrooge and youll keep your christmas by losing your situation
youre quite a powerful speaker sir he added turning to his nephew
i wonder you dont go into parliament
dont be angry uncle
dine with us tomorrow
scrooge said that he would see himyes indeed he did
he went the whole length of the expression and said that he would see him in that extremity first
cried scrooges nephew
why did you get married
said scrooge
because i fell in love
because you fell in love
growled scrooge as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry christmas
good afternoon
nay uncle but you never came to see me before that happened
why give it as a reason for not coming now
good afternoon said scrooge
i want nothing from you i ask nothing of you why cannot we be friends
good afternoon
said scrooge
i am sorry with all my heart to find you so resolute
we have never had any quarrel to which i have been a party
but i have made the trial in homage to christmas and ill keep my christmas humour to the last
so a merry christmas uncle
good afternoon said scrooge
and a happy new year
good afternoon
said scrooge
his nephew left the room without an angry word notwithstanding
he stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk who cold as he was was warmer than scrooge for he returned them cordially
theres another fellow muttered scrooge who overheard him my clerk with fifteen shillings a week and a wife and family talking about a merry christmas
ill retire to bedlam
this lunatic in letting scrooges nephew out had let two other people in
they were portly gentlemen pleasant to behold and now stood with their hats off in scrooges office
they had books and papers in their hands and bowed to him
scrooge and marleys i believe said one of the gentlemen referring to his list
have i the pleasure of addressing mr
scrooge or mr
marley has been dead these seven years scrooge replied
he died seven years ago this very night
we have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner said the gentleman presenting his credentials
illustration they were portly gentlemen pleasant to behold
it certainly was for they had been two kindred spirits
at the ominous word liberality scrooge frowned and shook his head and handed the credentials back
at this festive season of the year mr
scrooge said the gentleman taking up a pen it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute who suffer greatly at the present time
many thousands are in want of common necessaries hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts sir
are there no prisons
asked scrooge
plenty of prisons said the gentleman laying down the pen again
and the union workhouses
demanded scrooge
are they still in operation
still returned the gentleman i wish i could say they were not
the treadmill and the poor law are in full vigour then
said scrooge
both very busy sir
i was afraid from what you said at first that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course said scrooge
i am very glad to hear it
we choose this time because it is a time of all others when want is keenly felt and abundance rejoices
what shall i put you down for
scrooge replied
you wish to be anonymous
i wish to be left alone said scrooge
since you ask me what i wish gentlemen that is my answer
i dont make merry myself at christmas and i cant afford to make idle people merry
i help to support the establishments i have mentionedthey cost enough and those who are badly off must go there
many cant go there and many would rather die
if they would rather die said scrooge they had better do it and decrease the surplus population
besidesexcuse mei dont know that
but you might know it observed the gentleman
its not my business scrooge returned
its enough for a man to understand his own business and not to interfere with other peoples
mine occupies me constantly
good afternoon gentlemen
seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point the gentlemen withdrew
scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him
meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so that people ran about with flaring links proffering their services to go before horses in carriages and conduct them on their way
the ancient tower of a church whose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at scrooge out of a
gothic window in the wall became invisible and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there
the cold became intense
the waterplug being left in solitude its overflowings suddenly congealed and turned to misanthropic ice
the brightness of the shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows made pale faces ruddy as they passed
poulterers and grocers trades became a splendid joke a glorious pageant with which it was next to impossible to believe that such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do
foggier yet and colder
piercing searching biting cold
if the good
dunstan had but nipped the evil spirits nose with a touch of such weather as that instead of using his familiar weapons then indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose
scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled in terror leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial frost
at length the hour of shutting up the countinghouse arrived
with an illwill scrooge dismounted from his stool and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the tank who instantly snuffed his candle out and put on his hat
youll want all day tomorrow i suppose
said scrooge
if quite convenient sir
its not convenient said scrooge and its not fair
if i was to stop halfacrown for it youd think yourself ill used ill be bound
the clerk smiled faintly
and yet said scrooge you dont think me ill used when i pay a days wages for no work
illustration bob cratchit went down a slide on cornhill at the end of a lane of boys twenty times in honour of its being christmas
the clerk observed that it was only once a year
a poor excuse for picking a mans pocket every twentyfifth of
said scrooge buttoning his greatcoat to the chin
but i suppose you must have the whole day
be here all the earlier next morning
the clerk promised that he would and scrooge walked out with a growl
camden town as hard as he could pelt to play at blind mansbuff
scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern and having read all the newspapers and beguiled the rest of the evening with his bankers book went home to bed
he lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased partner
it was old enough now and dreary enough for nobody lived in it but scrooge the other rooms being all let out as offices
the yard was so dark that even scrooge who knew its every stone was fain to grope with his hands
the fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house that it seemed as if the genius of the weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold
now it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door except that it was very large
let it also be borne in mind that scrooge had not bestowed one thought on marley since his last mention of his sevenyearsdead partner that afternoon
marleys face
marleys face
it was not in impenetrable shadow as the other objects in the yard were but had a dismal light about it like a bad lobster in a dark cellar
it was not angry or ferocious but looked at scrooge as
marley used to look with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead
the hair was curiously stirred as if by breath or hot air and though the eyes were wide open they were perfectly motionless
that and its livid colour made it horrible but its horror seemed to be in spite of the face and beyond its control rather than a part of its own expression
as scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon it was a knocker again
to say that he was not startled or that his blood was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy would be untrue
but he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished turned it sturdily walked in and lighted his candle
but there was nothing on the back of the door except the screws and nuts that held the knocker on so he said pooh pooh
and closed it with a bang
the sound resounded through the house like thunder
every room above and every cask in the winemerchants cellars below appeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own
scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes
he fastened the door and walked across the hall and up the stairs slowly too trimming his candle as he went
there was plenty of width for that and room to spare which is perhaps the reason why scrooge thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom
halfadozen gaslamps out of the street wouldnt have lighted the entry too well so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with scrooges dip
up scrooge went not caring a button for that
darkness is cheap and
scrooge liked it
but before he shut his heavy door he walked through his rooms to see that all was right
he had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that
sittingroom bedroom lumberroom
all as they should be
nobody under the table nobody under the sofa a small fire in the grate spoon and basin ready and the little saucepan of gruel scrooge had a cold in his head upon the hob
nobody under the bed nobody in the closet nobody in his dressinggown which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against the wall
lumberroom as usual
old fireguard old shoes two fish baskets washingstand on three legs and a poker
illustration nobody under the bed nobody in the closet nobody in his dressinggown which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against the wall
quite satisfied he closed his door and locked himself in double locked himself in which was not his custom
thus secured against surprise he took off his cravat put on his dressinggown and slippers and his nightcap and sat down before the fire to take his gruel
it was a very low fire indeed nothing on such a bitter night
he was obliged to sit close to it and brood over it before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel
the fireplace was an old one built by some dutch merchant long ago and paved all round with quaint dutch tiles designed to illustrate the scriptures
there were cains and abels pharaohs daughters queens of sheba
said scrooge and walked across the room
after several turns he sat down again
it was with great astonishment and with a strange inexplicable dread that as he looked he saw this bell begin to swing
it swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made a sound but soon it rang out loudly and so did every bell in the house
this might have lasted half a minute or a minute but it seemed an hour
the bells ceased as they had begun together
they were succeeded by a clanking noise deep down below as if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the winemerchants cellar
scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains
the cellar door flew open with a booming sound and then he heard the noise much louder on the floors below then coming up the stairs then coming straight towards his door
its humbug still
said scrooge
i wont believe it
his colour changed though when without a pause it came on through the heavy door and passed into the room before his eyes
upon its coming in the dying flame leaped up as though it cried i know him
and fell again
the same face the very same
marley in his pigtail usual waistcoat tights and boots the tassels on the latter bristling like his pigtail and his coatskirts and the hair upon his head
the chain he drew was clasped about his middle
it was long and wound about him like a tail and it was made for scrooge observed it closely of cashboxes keys padlocks ledgers deeds and heavy purses wrought in steel
his body was transparent so that scrooge observing him and looking through his waistcoat could see the two buttons on his coat behind
scrooge had often heard it said that marley had no bowels but he had never believed it until now
no nor did he believe it even now
said scrooge caustic and cold as ever
what do you want with me
marleys voice no doubt about it
who are you
ask me who i was
who were you then
said scrooge raising his voice
youre particular for a shade
he was going to say to a shade but substituted this as more appropriate
in life i was your partner jacob marley
can youcan you sit down
asked scrooge looking doubtfully at him
do it then
but the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace as if he were quite used to it
you dont believe in me observed the ghost
i dont said scrooge
what evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your own senses
i dont know said scrooge
why do you doubt your senses
because said scrooge a little thing affects them
a slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats
you may be an undigested bit of beef a blot of mustard a crumb of cheese a fragment of an underdone potato
theres more of gravy than of grave about you whatever you are
scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes nor did he feel in his heart by any means waggish then
the truth is that he tried to be smart as a means of distracting his own attention and keeping down his terror for the spectres voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones
to sit staring at those fixed glazed eyes in silence for a moment would play scrooge felt the very deuce with him
there was something very awful too in the spectres being provided with an infernal atmosphere of his own
scrooge could not feel it himself but this was clearly the case for though the ghost sat perfectly motionless its hair and skirts and tassels were still agitated as by the hot vapour from an oven
you see this toothpick
said scrooge returning quickly to the charge for the reason just assigned and wishing though it were only for a second to divert the visions stony gaze from himself
i do replied the ghost
you are not looking at it said scrooge
but i see it said the ghost notwithstanding
returned scrooge i have but to swallow this and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins all of my own creation
humbug i tell you humbug
at this the spirit raised a frightful cry and shook its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise that scrooge held on tight to his chair to save himself from falling in a swoon
but how much greater was his horror when the phantom taking off the bandage round his head as if it were too warm to wear indoors its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast
scrooge fell upon his knees and clasped his hands before his face
dreadful apparition why do you trouble me
man of the worldly mind
replied the ghost do you believe in me or not
i do said scrooge i must
but why do spirits walk the earth and why do they come to me
it is doomed to wander through the worldoh woe is me
and witness what it cannot share but might have shared on earth and turned to happiness
again the spectre raised a cry and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands
you are fettered said scrooge trembling
tell me why
i wear the chain i forged in life replied the ghost
i made it link by link and yard by yard i girded it on of my own free will and of my own free will i wore it
is its pattern strange to you
scrooge trembled more and more
or would you know pursued the ghost the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself
it was full as heavy and as long as this seven christmas eves ago
you have laboured on it since
it is a ponderous chain
scrooge glanced about him on the floor in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable but he could see nothing
he said imploringly
old jacob marley tell me more
speak comfort to me jacob
i have none to give the ghost replied
it comes from other regions
ebenezer scrooge and is conveyed by other ministers to other kinds of men
nor can i tell you what i would
a very little more is all permitted to me
i cannot rest i cannot stay i cannot linger anywhere
my spirit never walked beyond our countinghousemark mein life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our moneychanging hole and weary journeys lie before me
it was a habit with scrooge whenever he became thoughtful to put his hands in his breeches pockets
pondering on what the ghost had said he did so now but without lifting up his eyes or getting off his knees
illustration on the wings of the wind you must have been very slow about it jacob scrooge observed in a businesslike manner though with humility and deference
the ghost repeated
seven years dead mused scrooge
and travelling all the time
the whole time said the ghost
no rest no peace
incessant torture of remorse
you travel fast
said scrooge
illustration on the wings of the wind replied the ghost
you might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years said scrooge
the ghost on hearing this set up another cry and clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of the night that the ward would have been justified in indicting it for a nuisance
not to know that any christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere whatever it may be will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness
not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one lifes opportunities misused
yet such was i
oh such was i
but you were always a good man of business jacob faltered scrooge who now began to apply this to himself
cried the ghost wringing its hands again
mankind was my business
the common welfare was my business charity mercy forbearance and benevolence were all my business
the dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business
it held up its chain at armslength as if that were the cause of all its unavailing grief and flung it heavily upon the ground again
at this time of the rolling year the spectre said i suffer most
why did i walk through crowds of fellowbeings with my eyes turned down and never raise them to that blessed star which led the wise men to a poor abode
were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me
scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate and began to quake exceedingly
cried the ghost
my time is nearly gone
i will said scrooge
but dont be hard upon me
dont be flowery
how it is that i appear before you in a shape that you can see i may not tell
i have sat invisible beside you many and many a day
it was not an agreeable idea
scrooge shivered and wiped the perspiration from his brow
that is no light part of my penance pursued the ghost
i am here tonight to warn you that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate
a chance and hope of my procuring ebenezer
you were always a good friend to me said scrooge
you will be haunted resumed the ghost by three spirits
scrooges countenance fell almost as low as the ghosts had done
is that the chance and hope you mentioned jacob
he demanded in a faltering voice
ii think id rather not said scrooge
without their visits said the ghost you cannot hope to shun the path i tread
expect the first tomorrow when the bell tolls one
couldnt i take em all at once and have it over jacob
expect the second on the next night at the same hour
the third upon the next night when the last stroke of twelve has ceased to vibrate
look to see me no more and look that for your own sake you remember what has passed between us
when it had said these words the spectre took its wrapper from the table and bound it round its head as before
scrooge knew this by the smart sound its teeth made when the jaws were brought together by the bandage
he ventured to raise his eyes again and found his supernatural visitor confronting him in an erect attitude with its chain wound over and about its arm
illustration the air was filled with phantoms wandering hither and thither in restless haste and moaning as they went
the apparition walked backward from him and at every step it took the window raised itself a little so that when the spectre reached it it was wide open
it beckoned scrooge to approach which he did
when they were within two paces of each other marleys ghost held up its hand warning him to come no nearer
scrooge stopped
the spectre after listening for a moment joined in the mournful dirge and floated out upon the bleak dark night
scrooge followed to the window desperate in his curiosity
he looked out
the air was filled with phantoms wandering hither and thither in restless haste and moaning as they went
every one of them wore chains like marleys ghost some few they might be guilty governments were linked together none were free
many had been personally known to
scrooge in their lives
the misery with them all was clearly that they sought to interfere for good in human matters and had lost the power for ever
whether these creatures faded into mist or mist enshrouded them he could not tell
but they and their spirit voices faded together and the night became as it had been when he walked home
scrooge closed the window and examined the door by which the ghost had entered
it was double locked as he had locked it with his own hands and the bolts were undisturbed
he tried to say humbug
but stopped at the first syllable
illustration
stave two illustration
the first of the three spirits
when scrooge awoke it was so dark that looking out of bed he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber
he was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters
so he listened for the hour
to his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from six to seven and from seven to eight and regularly up to twelve then stopped
it was past two when he went to bed
the clock was wrong
an icicle must have got into the works
he touched the spring of his repeater to correct this most preposterous clock
its rapid little pulse beat twelve and stopped
why it isnt possible said scrooge that i can have slept through a whole day and far into another night
it isnt possible that anything has happened to the sun and this is twelve at noon
the idea being an alarming one he scrambled out of bed and groped his way to the window
he was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his dressinggown before he could see anything and could see very little then
this was a great relief because three days after sight of this first of
exchange pay to mr
ebenezer scrooge or his order and so forth would have become a mere united states security if there were no days to count by
scrooge went to bed again and thought and thought and thought it over and over and could make nothing of it
the more he thought the more perplexed he was and the more he endeavoured not to think the more he thought
marleys ghost bothered him exceedingly
scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone threequarters more when he remembered on a sudden that the ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one
he resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed and considering that he could no more go to sleep than go to heaven this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power
the quarter was so long that he was more than once convinced he must have sunk into a doze unconsciously and missed the clock
at length it broke upon his listening ear
a quarter past said scrooge counting
half past said scrooge
a quarter to it
said scrooge
the hour itself said scrooge triumphantly and nothing else
he spoke before the hour bell sounded which it now did with a deep dull hollow melancholy one
light flashed up in the room upon the instant and the curtains of his bed were drawn
the curtains of his bed were drawn aside i tell you by a hand
not the curtains at his feet nor the curtains at his back but those to which his face was addressed
the curtains of his bed were drawn aside and scrooge starting up into a halfrecumbent attitude found himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them as close to it as
i am now to you and i am standing in the spirit at your elbow
its hair which hung about its neck and down its back was white as if with age and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it and the tenderest bloom was on the skin
the arms were very long and muscular the hands the same as if its hold were of uncommon strength
its legs and feet most delicately formed were like those upper members bare
it wore a tunic of the purest white and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt the sheen of which was beautiful
it held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand and in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem had its dress trimmed with summer flowers
even this though when scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness was not its strangest quality
and in the very wonder of this it would be itself again distinct and clear as ever
are you the spirit sir whose coming was foretold to me
the voice was soft and gentle
singularly low as if instead of being so close behind him it were at a distance
who and what are you
scrooge demanded
i am the ghost of christmas past
inquired scrooge observant of its dwarfish stature
perhaps scrooge could not have told anybody why if anybody could have asked him but he had a special desire to see the spirit in his cap and begged him to be covered
exclaimed the ghost would you so soon put out with worldly hands the light i give
is it not enough that you are one of those whose passions made this cap and force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon my brow
scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge of having wilfully bonneted the spirit at any period of his life
he then made bold to inquire what business brought him there
your welfare
said the ghost
scrooge expressed himself much obliged but could not help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end
spirit must have heard him thinking for it said immediately your reclamation then
it put out its strong hand as it spoke and clasped him gently by the arm
and walk with me
the grasp though gentle as a womans hand was not to be resisted
he rose but finding that the spirit made towards the window clasped its robe in supplication
i am a mortal scrooge remonstrated and liable to fall
bear but a touch of my hand there said the spirit laying it upon his heart and you shall be upheld in more than this
as the words were spoken they passed through the wall and stood upon an open country road with fields on either hand
the city had entirely vanished
not a vestige of it was to be seen
the darkness and the mist had vanished with it for it was a clear cold winter day with snow upon the ground
good heaven
said scrooge clasping his hands together as he looked about him
i was bred in this place
i was a boy here
the spirit gazed upon him mildly
its gentle touch though it had been light and instantaneous appeared still present to the old mans sense of feeling
he was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air each one connected with a thousand thoughts and hopes and joys and cares long long forgotten
your lip is trembling said the ghost
and what is that upon your cheek
scrooge muttered with an unusual catching in his voice that it was a pimple and begged the ghost to lead him where he would
you recollect the way
inquired the spirit
remember it
cried scrooge with fervour i could walk it blindfold
strange to have forgotten it for so many years
observed the ghost
let us go on
they walked along the road scrooge recognising every gate and post and tree until a little markettown appeared in the distance with its bridge its church and winding river
some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their backs who called to other boys in country gigs and carts driven by farmers
all these boys were in great spirits and shouted to each other until the broad fields were so full of merry music that the crisp air laughed to hear it
these are but shadows of the things that have been said the ghost
they have no consciousness of us
the jocund travellers came on and as they came scrooge knew and named them every one
why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them
why did his cold eye glisten and his heart leap up as they went past
why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other merry
christmas as they parted at crossroads and byways for their several homes
what was merry christmas to scrooge
out upon merry christmas
what good had it ever done to him
the school is not quite deserted said the ghost
a solitary child neglected by his friends is left there still
scrooge said he knew it
and he sobbed
they left the highroad by a wellremembered lane and soon approached a mansion of dull red brick with a little weathercock surmounted cupola on the roof and a bell hanging in it
it was a large house but one of broken fortunes for the spacious offices were little used their walls were damp and mossy their windows broken and their gates decayed
fowls clucked and strutted in the stables and the coachhouses and sheds were overrun with grass
nor was it more retentive of its ancient state within for entering the dreary hall and glancing through the open doors of many rooms they found them poorly furnished cold and vast
there was an earthy savour in the air a chilly bareness in the place which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by candle light and not too much to eat
they went the ghost and scrooge across the hall to a door at the back of the house
it opened before them and disclosed a long bare melancholy room made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks
at one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire and
scrooge sat down upon a form and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he had used to be
the spirit touched him on the arm and pointed to his younger self intent upon his reading
suddenly a man in foreign garments wonderfully real and distinct to look at stood outside the window with an axe stuck in his belt and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood
why its ali baba
scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy
its dear old honest ali baba
yes yes i know
one christmastime when yonder solitary child was left here all alone he did come for the first time just like that
and valentine said scrooge and his wild brother orson there they go
and whats his name who was put down in his drawers asleep at the gate of damascus dont you see him
and the sultans groom turned upside down by the genii there he is upon his head
serve him right
im glad of it
what business had he to be married to the princess
theres the parrot
cried scrooge
green body and yellow tail with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head there he is
poor robin crusoe he called him when he came home again after sailing round the island
poor robin crusoe where have you been robin
the man thought he was dreaming but he wasnt
it was the
parrot you know
there goes friday running for his life to the little creek
then with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character he said in pity for his former self poor boy
and cried again
i wish scrooge muttered putting his hand in his pocket and looking about him after drying his eyes with his cuff but its too late now
what is the matter
asked the spirit
nothing said scrooge
there was a boy singing a christmas carol at my door last night
i should like to have given him something thats all
the ghost smiled thoughtfully and waved its hand saying as it did so let us see another christmas
scrooges former self grew larger at the words and the room became a little darker and more dirty
the panels shrunk the windows cracked fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling and the naked laths were shown instead but how all this was brought about scrooge knew no more than you do
he only knew that it was quite correct that everything had happened so that there he was alone again when all the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays
he was not reading now but walking up and down despairingly
scrooge looked at the ghost and with a mournful shaking of his head glanced anxiously towards the door
it opened and a little girl much younger than the boy came darting in and putting her arms about his neck and often kissing him addressed him as her dear dear brother
i have come to bring you home dear brother
said the child clapping her tiny hands and bending down to laugh
to bring you home home home
home little fan
returned the boy
said the child brimful of glee
home for good and all
home for ever and ever
father is so much kinder than he used to be that homes like heaven
he spoke so gently to me one dear night when i was going to bed that i was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home and he said yes you should and sent me in a coach to bring you
and youre to be a man
said the child opening her eyes and are never to come back here but first were to be together all the christmas long and have the merriest time in all the world
you are quite a woman little fan
exclaimed the boy
she clapped her hands and laughed and tried to touch his head but being too little laughed again and stood on tiptoe to embrace him
then she began to drag him in her childish eagerness towards the door and he nothing loath to go accompanied her
a terrible voice in the hall cried bring down master scrooges box there
and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself who glared on
master scrooge with a ferocious condescension and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him
illustration he produced a decanter of curiously light wine and a
block of curiously heavy cake always a delicate creature whom a breath might have withered said the ghost
but she had a large heart
so she had cried scrooge
youre right
i will not gainsay it
god forbid
she died a woman said the ghost and had as i think children
one child scrooge returned
true said the ghost
your nephew
scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind and answered briefly yes
it was made plain enough by the dressing of the shops that here too it was christmastime again but it was evening and the streets were lighted up
the ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door and asked scrooge if he knew it
said scrooge
was i apprenticed here
they went in
bless his heart its fezziwig alive again
old fezziwig laid down his pen and looked up at the clock which pointed to the hour of seven
he rubbed his hands adjusted his capacious waistcoat laughed all over himself from his shoes to his organ of benevolence and called out in a comfortable oily rich fat jovial voice yo ho there
scrooges former self now grown a young man came briskly in accompanied by his fellowprentice
dick wilkins to be sure
said scrooge to the ghost
bless me yes
there he is
he was very much attached to me was dick
yo ho my boys
said fezziwig
no more work tonight
christmas eve
christmas ebenezer
lets have the shutters up cried old
fezziwig with a sharp clap of his hands before a man can say jack
you wouldnt believe how those two fellows went at it
cried old fezziwig skipping down from the high desk with wonderful agility
clear away my lads and lets have lots of room here
hilliho dick
chirrup ebenezer
clear away
there was nothing they wouldnt have cleared away or couldnt have cleared away with old fezziwig looking on
it was done in a minute
in came a fiddler with a musicbook and went up to the lofty desk and made an orchestra of it and tuned like fifty stomachaches
fezziwig one vast substantial smile
in came the three miss
fezziwigs beaming and lovable
in came the six young followers whose hearts they broke
in came all the young men and women employed in the business
in came the housemaid with her cousin the baker
in came the cook with her brothers particular friend the milkman
in they all came one after another some shyly some boldly some gracefully some awkwardly some pushing some pulling in they all came any how and every how
when this result was brought about old fezziwig clapping his hands to stop the dance cried out well done
and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter especially provided for that purpose
illustration then old fezziwig stood out to dance with mrs
there were more dances and there were forfeits and more dances and there was cake and there was negus and there was a great piece of cold
roast and there was a great piece of cold boiled and there were mincepies and plenty of beer
but the great effect of the evening came after the roast and boiled when the fiddler an artful dog mind
the sort of man who knew his business better than you or i could have told it him
struck up sir roger de coverley
then old fezziwig stood out to dance with mrs
top couple too with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them three or four and twenty pair of partners people who were not to be trifled with people who would dance and had no notion of walking
but if they had been twice as manyah
four timesold fezziwig would have been a match for them and so would mrs
as to her she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term
if thats not high praise tell me higher and ill use it
a positive light appeared to issue from fezziwigs calves
they shone in every part of the dance like moons
you couldnt have predicted at any given time what would become of them next
and when old fezziwig and mrs
when the clock struck eleven this domestic ball broke up
fezziwig took their stations one on either side the door and shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out wished him or her a merry christmas
when everybody had retired but the two prentices they did the same to them and thus the cheerful voices died away and the lads were left to their beds which were under a counter in the backshop
during the whole of this time scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits
his heart and soul were in the scene and with his former self
he corroborated everything remembered everything enjoyed everything and underwent the strangest agitation
a small matter said the ghost to make these silly folks so full of gratitude
echoed scrooge
the spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices who were pouring out their hearts in praise of fezziwig and when he had done so said why
he has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money three or four perhaps
is that so much that he deserves this praise
it isnt that said scrooge heated by the remark and speaking unconsciously like his former not his latter self
it isnt that
he has the power to render us happy or unhappy to make our service light or burdensome a pleasure or a toil
say that his power lies in words and looks in things so slight and insignificant that it is impossible to add and count em up what then
the happiness he gives is quite as great as if it cost a fortune
he felt the spirits glance and stopped
what is the matter
asked the ghost
nothing particular said scrooge
something i think
the ghost insisted
no said scrooge no
i should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now
his former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish and scrooge and the ghost again stood side by side in the open air
my time grows short observed the spirit
this was not addressed to scrooge or to any one whom he could see but it produced an immediate effect
for again scrooge saw himself
he was older now a man in the prime of life
his face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later years but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice
there was an eager greedy restless motion in the eye which showed the passion that had taken root and where the shadow of the growing tree would fall
he was not alone but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning dress in whose eyes there were tears which sparkled in the light that shone out of the ghost of christmas past
it matters little she said softly
to you very little
another idol has displaced me and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come as i would have tried to do i have no just cause to grieve
what idol has displaced you
he rejoined
a golden one
this is the evenhanded dealing of the world
there is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty and there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth
you fear the world too much she answered gently
all your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid reproach
i have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one until the master passion gain engrosses you
have i not
he retorted
even if i have grown so much wiser what then
i am not changed towards you
she shook her head
our contract is an old one
it was made when we were both poor and content to be so until in good season we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry
you are changed
when it was made you were another man
i was a boy he said impatiently
your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are she returned
that which promised happiness when we were one in heart is fraught with misery now that we are two
how often and how keenly i have thought of this i will not say
it is enough that i have thought of it and can release you
have i ever sought release
in what then
in a changed nature in an altered spirit in another atmosphere of life another hope as its great end
in everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight
if this had never been between us said the girl looking mildly but with steadiness upon him tell me would you seek me out and try to win me now
he seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition in spite of himself
but he said with a struggle you think not
i would gladly think otherwise if i could she answered
heaven knows
when i have learned a truth like this i know how strong and irresistible it must be
but if you were free today tomorrow yesterday can even i believe that you would choose a dowerless girlyou who in your very confidence with her weigh everything by
gain or choosing her if for a moment you were false enough to your one guiding principle to do so do i not know that your repentance and regret would surely follow
i do and i release you
with a full heart for the love of him you once were
illustration she left him and they parted
he was about to speak but with her head turned from him she resumed you maythe memory of what is past half makes me hope you willhave pain in this
a very very brief time and you will dismiss the recollection of it gladly as an unprofitable dream from which it happened well that you awoke
may you be happy in the life you have chosen
she left him and they parted
said scrooge show me no more
conduct me home
why do you delight to torture me
one shadow more
exclaimed the ghost
cried scrooge
i dont wish to see it
show me no more
but the relentless ghost pinioned him in both his arms and forced him to observe what happened next
they were in another scene and place a room not very large or handsome but full of comfort
near to the winter fire sat a beautiful young girl so like that last that scrooge believed it was the same until he saw her now a comely matron sitting opposite her daughter
what would i not have given to be one of them
though i never could have been so rude no no
i wouldnt for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair and torn it down and for the precious little shoe i wouldnt have plucked it off god bless my soul
to save my life
as to measuring her waist in sport as they did bold young brood i couldnt have done it i should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment and never come straight again
illustration a flushed and boisterous group
then the shouting and the struggling and the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter
the shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package was received
the immense relief of finding this a false alarm
the joy and gratitude and ecstasy
they are all indescribable alike
it is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions got out of the parlour and by one stair at a time up to the top of the house where they went to bed and so subsided
belle said the husband turning to his wife with a smile i saw an old friend of yours this afternoon
who was it
tut dont i know
she added in the same breath laughing as he laughed
scrooge it was
i passed his office window and as it was not shut up and he had a candle inside i could scarcely help seeing him
his partner lies upon the point of death i hear and there he sat alone
quite alone in the world i do believe
said scrooge in a broken voice remove me from this place
i told you these were shadows of the things that have been said the
that they are what they are do not blame me
scrooge exclaimed i cannot bear it
he turned upon the ghost and seeing that it looked upon him with a face in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it had shown him wrestled with it
take me back
haunt me no longer
illustration laden with christmas toys and presents
he was conscious of being exhausted and overcome by an irresistible drowsiness and further of being in his own bedroom
he gave the cap a parting squeeze in which his hand relaxed and had barely time to reel to bed before he sank into a heavy sleep
illustration
stave three illustration
the second of the three spirits
awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore and sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together scrooge had no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the stroke of one
he felt that he was restored to consciousness in the right nick of time for the especial purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to him through jacob marleys intervention
for he wished to challenge the spirit on the moment of its appearance and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous
now being prepared for almost anything he was not by any means prepared for nothing and consequently when the bell struck one and no shape appeared he was taken with a violent fit of trembling
five minutes ten minutes a quarter of an hour went by yet nothing came
this idea taking full possession of his mind he got up softly and shuffled in his slippers to the door
the moment scrooges hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by his name and bade him enter
it was his own room
there was no doubt about that
but it had undergone a surprising transformation
the walls and ceiling were so hung with living green that it looked a perfect grove from every part of which bright gleaming berries glistened
in easy state upon this couch there sat a jolly giant glorious to see who bore a glowing torch in shape not unlike plentys horn and held it up high up to shed its light on
scrooge as he came peeping round the door
exclaimed the ghost
and know me better man
scrooge entered timidly and hung his head before this spirit
he was not the dogged scrooge he had been and though the spirits eyes were clear and kind he did not like to meet them
i am the ghost of christmas present said the spirit
look upon me
scrooge reverently did so
it was clothed in one simple deep green robe or mantle bordered with white fur
this garment hung so loosely on the figure that its capacious breast was bare as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any artifice
its feet observable beneath the ample folds of the garment were also bare and on its head it wore no other covering than a holly wreath set here and there with shining icicles
its darkbrown curls were long and free free as its genial face its sparkling eye its open hand its cheery voice its unconstrained demeanour and its joyful air
girded round its middle was an antique scabbard but no sword was in it and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust
you have never seen the like of me before
exclaimed the spirit
never scrooge made answer to it
have never walked forth with the younger members of my family meaning for i am very young my elder brothers born in these later years
pursued the phantom
i dont think i have said scrooge
i am afraid i have not
have you had many brothers spirit
more than eighteen hundred said the ghost
a tremendous family to provide for muttered scrooge
the ghost of christmas present rose
spirit said scrooge submissively conduct me where you will
i went forth last night on compulsion and i learned a lesson which is working now
tonight if you have aught to teach me let me profit by it
touch my robe
scrooge did as he was told and held it fast
holly mistletoe red berries ivy turkeys geese game poultry brawn meat pigs sausages oysters pies puddings fruit and punch all vanished instantly
illustration there was nothing very cheerful in the climate
the poulterers shops were still half open and the fruiterers were radiant in their glory
the grocers
oh the grocers
nearly closed with perhaps two shutters down or one but through those gaps such glimpses
but soon the steeples called good people all to church and chapel and away they came flocking through the streets in their best clothes and with their gayest faces
and at the same time there emerged from scores of bystreets lanes and nameless turnings innumerable people carrying their dinners to the bakers shops
the sight of these poor revellers appeared to interest the spirit very much for he stood with
scrooge beside him in a bakers doorway and taking off the covers as their bearers passed sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch
for they said it was a shame to quarrel upon christmas day
and so it was
god love it so it was
is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch
asked scrooge
would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day
asked scrooge
to any kindly given
to a poor one most
why to a poor one most
asked scrooge
because it needs it most
said scrooge after a moments thought i wonder you of all the beings in the many worlds about us should desire to cramp these peoples opportunities of innocent enjoyment
cried the spirit
you would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all said
scrooge wouldnt you
cried the spirit
you seek to close these places on the seventh day said scrooge
and it comes to the same thing
exclaimed the spirit
forgive me if i am wrong
it has been done in your name or at least in that of your family said scrooge
remember that and charge their doings on themselves not us
scrooge promised that he would and they went on invisible as they had been before into the suburbs of the town
think of that
bob had but fifteen bob a week himself he pocketed on
saturdays but fifteen copies of his christian name and yet the ghost of
christmas present blessed his fourroomed house
then up rose mrs
cratchit cratchits wife dressed out but poorly in a twiceturned gown but brave in ribbons which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence and she laid the cloth assisted by belinda
cratchit second of her daughters also brave in ribbons while master
what has ever got your precious father then
and your brother tiny tim
and martha warnt as late last christmas day by half an hour
heres martha mother
said a girl appearing as she spoke
heres martha mother
cried the two young cratchits
theres such a goose martha
why bless your heart alive my dear how late you are
cratchit kissing her a dozen times and taking off her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal
wed a deal of work to finish up last night replied the girl and had to clear away this morning mother
never mind so long as you are come said mrs
sit ye down before the fire my dear and have a warm lord bless ye
theres father coming cried the two young cratchits who were everywhere at once
hide martha hide
alas for tiny tim he bore a little crutch and had his limbs supported by an iron frame
why wheres our martha
cried bob cratchit looking round
not coming said mrs
not coming
said bob with a sudden declension in his high spirits for he had been tims bloodhorse all the way from church and had come home rampant
not coming upon christmas day
and how did little tim behave
cratchit when she had rallied bob on his credulity and bob had hugged his daughter to his hearts content
as good as gold said bob and better
somehow he gets thoughtful sitting by himself so much and thinks the strangest things you ever heard
bobs voice was tremulous when he told them this and trembled more when he said that tiny tim was growing strong and hearty
his active little crutch was heard upon the floor and back came tiny
peter and the two ubiquitous young cratchits went to fetch the goose with which they soon returned in high procession
illustration
cratchit made the gravy ready beforehand in a little saucepan hissing hot master peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour miss
belinda sweetened up the apple sauce martha dusted the hot plates bob took tiny tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table the two young
cratchits set chairs for everybody not forgetting themselves and mounting guard upon their posts crammed spoons into their mouths lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped
at last the dishes were set on and grace was said
it was succeeded by a breathless pause as mrs
illustration he had been tims bloodhorse all the way from church
there never was such a goose
bob said he didnt believe there ever was such a goose cooked
its tenderness and flavour size and cheapness were the themes of universal admiration
eked out by apple sauce and mashed potatoes it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family indeed as mrs
cratchit said with great delight surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish they hadnt ate it all at last
yet every one had had enough and the youngest cratchits in particular were steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows
but now the plates being changed by miss belinda mrs
cratchit left the room alonetoo nervous to bear witnessesto take the pudding up and bring it in
suppose it should not be done enough
suppose it should break in turning out
suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the backyard and stolen it while they were merry with the goosea supposition at which the two young cratchits became livid
all sorts of horrors were supposed
a great deal of steam
the pudding was out of the copper
a smell like a washingday
that was the cloth
a smell like an eatinghouse and a pastrycooks next door to each other with a laundresss next door to that
that was the pudding
in half a minute mrs
oh a wonderful pudding
bob cratchit said and calmly too that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by mrs
cratchit since their marriage
cratchit said that now the weight was off her mind she would confess she had her doubts about the quantity of flour
everybody had something to say about it but nobody said or thought it was at all a small pudding for a large family
it would have been flat heresy to do so
any cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing
illustration with the pudding
at last the dinner was all done the cloth was cleared the hearth swept and the fire made up
the compound in the jug being tasted and considered perfect apples and oranges were put upon the table and a shovel full of chestnuts on the fire
then all the cratchit family drew round the hearth in what bob cratchit called a circle meaning half a one and at bob cratchits elbow stood the family display of glass
two tumblers and a custard cup without a handle
these held the hot stuff from the jug however as well as golden goblets would have done and bob served it out with beaming looks while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily
then bob proposed a merry christmas to us all my dears
god bless us
which all the family reechoed
god bless us every one
said tiny tim the last of all
he sat very close to his fathers side upon his little stool
bob held his withered little hand to his as if he loved the child and wished to keep him by his side and dreaded that he might be taken from him
spirit said scrooge with an interest he had never felt before tell me if tiny tim will live
i see a vacant seat replied the ghost in the poor chimney corner and a crutch without an owner carefully preserved
if these shadows remain unaltered by the future the child will die
no no said scrooge
oh no kind spirit
say he will be spared
if these shadows remain unaltered by the future none other of my race returned the ghost will find him here
if he be like to die he had better do it and decrease the surplus population
scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the spirit and was overcome with penitence and grief
man said the ghost if man you be in heart not adamant forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered what the surplus is and where it is
will you decide what men shall live what men shall die
it may be that in the sight of heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor mans child
to hear the insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust
scrooge bent before the ghosts rebuke and trembling cast his eyes upon the ground
but he raised them speedily on hearing his own name
ill give you mr
scrooge the founder of the
the founder of the feast indeed
cratchit reddening
i wish i had him here
id give him a piece of my mind to feast upon and
i hope hed have a good appetite for it
my dear said bob the children
christmas day
it should be christmas day i am sure said she on which one drinks the health of such an odious stingy hard unfeeling man as mr
you know he is robert
nobody knows it better than you do poor fellow
was bobs mild answer
christmas day
ill drink his health for your sake and the days said mrs
cratchit not for his
long life to him
a merry christmas and a happy new year
hell be very merry and very happy i have no doubt
the children drank the toast after her
it was the first of their proceedings which had no heartiness in it
tiny tim drank it last of all but he didnt care twopence for it
scrooge was the ogre of the family
the mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party which was not dispelled for full five minutes
after it had passed away they were ten times merrier than before from the mere relief of scrooge the baleful being done with
bob cratchit told them how he had a situation in his eye for master peter which would bring in if obtained full fiveandsixpence weekly
all this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round and byandby they had a song about a lost child travelling in the snow from tiny
tim who had a plaintive little voice and sang it very well indeed
there was nothing of high mark in this
tim until the last
by this time it was getting dark and snowing pretty heavily and as
scrooge and the spirit went along the streets the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens parlours and all sorts of rooms was wonderful
here the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner with hot plates baking through and through before the fire and deep red curtains ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness
there all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters brothers cousins uncles aunts and be the first to greet them
blessings on it how the ghost exulted
how it bared its breadth of breast and opened its capacious palm and floated on outpouring with a generous hand its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach
what place is this
asked scrooge
a place where miners live who labour in the bowels of the earth returned the spirit
but they know me
a light shone from the window of a hut and swiftly they advanced towards it
passing through the wall of mud and stone they found a cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire
an old old man and woman with their children and their childrens children and another generation beyond that all decked out gaily in their holiday attire
so surely as they raised their voices the old man got quite blithe and loud and so surely as they stopped his vigour sank again
the spirit did not tarry here but bade scrooge hold his robe and passing on above the moor sped whither
not to sea
built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks some league or so from shore on which the waters chafed and dashed the wild year through there stood a solitary lighthouse
great heaps of seaweed clung to its base and stormbirdsborn of the wind one might suppose as seaweed of the waterrose and fell about it like the waves they skimmed
but even here two men who watched the light had made a fire that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of brightness on the awful sea
again the ghost sped on above the black and heaving seaon onuntil being far away as he told scrooge from any shore they lighted on a ship
it was a much greater surprise to
scrooge to recognise it as his own nephews and to find himself in a bright dry gleaming room with the spirit standing smiling by his side and looking at that same nephew with approving affability
laughed scrooges nephew
if you should happen by any unlikely chance to know a man more blessed in a laugh than scrooges nephew all i can say is i should like to know him too
introduce him to me and ill cultivate his acquaintance
it is a fair evenhanded noble adjustment of things that while there is infection in disease and sorrow there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and goodhumour
when scrooges nephew laughed in this wayholding his sides rolling his head and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortionsscrooges niece by marriage laughed as heartily as he
and their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand roared out lustily
ha ha ha ha
he said that christmas was a humbug as i live
cried scrooges nephew
he believed it too
more shame for him fred
said scrooges niece indignantly
bless those women
they never do anything by halves
they are always in earnest
she was very pretty exceedingly pretty
altogether she was what you would have called provoking you know but satisfactory too
oh perfectly satisfactory
hes a comical old fellow said scrooges nephew thats the truth and not so pleasant as he might be
however his offences carry their own punishment and i have nothing to say against him
im sure he is very rich fred hinted scrooges niece
at least you always tell me so
what of that my dear
said scrooges nephew
his wealth is of no use to him
he dont do any good with it
he dont make himself comfortable with it
he hasnt the satisfaction of thinkingha ha ha
that he is ever going to benefit us with it
i have no patience with him observed scrooges niece
scrooges nieces sisters and all the other ladies expressed the same opinion
said scrooges nephew
i am sorry for him i couldnt be angry with him if i tried
who suffers by his ill whims
himself always
here he takes it into his head to dislike us and he wont come and dine with us
whats the consequence
he dont lose much of a dinner
indeed i think he loses a very good dinner interrupted scrooges niece
everybody else said the same and they must be allowed to have been competent judges because they had just had dinner and with the dessert upon the table were clustered round the fire by lamplight
i am very glad to hear it said scrooges nephew because i havent any great faith in these young housekeepers
what do you say
topper had clearly got his eye upon one of scrooges nieces sisters for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast who had no right to express an opinion on the subject
whereat scrooges nieces sisterthe plump one with the lace tucker not the one with the rosesblushed
do go on fred said scrooges niece clapping her hands
he never finishes what he begins to say
he is such a ridiculous fellow
scrooges nephew revelled in another laugh and as it was impossible to keep the infection off though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar his example was unanimously followed
i am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts either in his mouldy old office or his dusty chambers
i mean to give him the same chance every year whether he likes it or not for
i pity him
he may rail at christmas till he dies but he cant help thinking better of iti defy himif he finds me going there in good temper year after year and saying uncle scrooge how are you
if it only put him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds thats something and i think i shook him yesterday
it was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking scrooge
but being thoroughly goodnatured and not much caring what they laughed at so that they laughed at any rate he encouraged them in their merriment and passed the bottle joyously
after tea they had some music
scrooges niece played well upon the harp and played among other tunes a simple little air a mere nothing you might learn to whistle it in two minutes which had been familiar to the child who fetched
scrooge from the boardingschool as he had been reminded by the ghost of christmas past
illustration the way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker
but they didnt devote the whole evening to music
after a while they played at forfeits for it is good to be children sometimes and never better than at christmas when its mighty founder was a child himself
there was first a game at blind mansbuff
of course there was
and i no more believe topper was really blind than i believe he had eyes in his boots
my opinion is that it was a done thing between him and
scrooges nephew and that the ghost of christmas present knew it
the way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on the credulity of human nature
knocking down the fireirons tumbling over the chairs bumping up against the piano smothering himself amongst the curtains wherever she went there went he
he always knew where the plump sister was
he wouldnt catch anybody else
she often cried out that it wasnt fair and it really was not
but when at last he caught her when in spite of all her silken rustlings and her rapid flutterings past him he got her into a corner whence there was no escape then his conduct was the most execrable
no doubt she told him her opinion of it when another blind man being in office they were so very confidential together behind the curtains
scrooges niece was not one of the blind mansbuff party but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool in a snug corner where the ghost and scrooge were close behind her
but she joined in the forfeits and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet
likewise at the game of how when and where she was very great and to the secret joy of scrooges nephew beat her sisters hollow though they were sharp girls too as topper could have told you
the ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood and looked upon him with such favour that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed
but this the spirit said could not be done
here is a new game said scrooge
one halfhour spirit only one
it was a game called yes and no where scrooges nephew had to think of something and the rest must find out what he only answering to their questions yes or no as the case was
at every fresh question that was put to him this nephew burst into a fresh roar of laughter and was so inexpressibly tickled that he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp
at last the plump sister falling into a similar state cried out i have found it out
i know what it is fred
i know what it is
what is it
cried fred
its your uncle scroooooge
which it certainly was
admiration was the universal sentiment though some objected that the reply to is it a bear
ought to have been yes inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts from mr
scrooge supposing they had ever had any tendency that way
he has given us plenty of merriment i am sure said fred and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health
here is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the moment and i say uncle scrooge
uncle scrooge
they cried
a merry christmas and a happy new year to the old man whatever he is
said scrooges nephew
he wouldnt take it from me but may he have it nevertheless
uncle scrooge
uncle scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart that he would have pledged the unconscious company in return and thanked them in an inaudible speech if the ghost had given him time
but the whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his nephew and he and the spirit were again upon their travels
much they saw and far they went and many homes they visited but always with a happy end
the spirit stood beside sickbeds and they were cheerful on foreign lands and they were close at home by struggling men and they were patient in their greater hope by poverty and it was rich
in almshouse hospital and gaol in miserys every refuge where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast the door and barred the spirit out he left his blessing and taught
scrooge his precepts
it was a long night if it were only a night but scrooge had his doubts of this because the christmas holidays appeared to be condensed into the space of time they passed together
it was strange too that while
scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form the ghost grew older clearly older
scrooge had observed this change but never spoke of it until they left a childrens twelfthnight party when looking at the
spirit as they stood together in an open place he noticed that its hair was grey
are spirits lives so short
asked scrooge
my life upon this globe is very brief replied the ghost
it ends tonight
cried scrooge
tonight at midnight
the time is drawing near
the chimes were ringing the threequarters past eleven at that moment
forgive me if i am not justified in what i ask said scrooge looking intently at the spirits robe but i see something strange and not belonging to yourself protruding from your skirts
is it a foot or a claw
it might be a claw for the flesh there is upon it was the spirits sorrowful reply
from the foldings of its robe it brought two children wretched abject frightful hideous miserable
they knelt down at its feet and clung upon the outside of its garment
look look down here
exclaimed the ghost
they were a boy and girl
yellow meagre ragged scowling wolfish but prostrate too in their humility
where angels might have sat enthroned devils lurked and glared out menacing
no change no degradation no perversion of humanity in any grade through all the mysteries of wonderful creation has monsters half so horrible and dread
scrooge started back appalled
having them shown to him in this way he tried to say they were fine children but the words choked themselves rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude
are they yours
scrooge could say no more
they are mans said the spirit looking down upon them
and they cling to me appealing from their fathers
this boy is ignorance
this girl is want
beware of them both and all of their degree but most of all beware this boy for on his brow i see that written which is doom unless the writing be erased
cried the spirit stretching out his hand towards the city
slander those who tell it ye
admit it for your factious purposes and make it worse
and bide the end
have they no refuge or resource
cried scrooge
are there no prisons
said the spirit turning on him for the last time with his own words
are there no workhouses
the bell struck twelve
scrooge looked about him for the ghost and saw it not
as the last stroke ceased to vibrate he remembered the prediction of old jacob
marley and lifting up his eyes beheld a solemn phantom draped and hooded coming like a mist along the ground towards him
stave four
the last of the spirits
the phantom slowly gravely silently approached
when it came near him
scrooge bent down upon his knee for in the very air through which this
spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery
it was shrouded in a deep black garment which concealed its head its face its form and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand
but for this it would have been difficult to detach its figure from the night and separate it from the darkness by which it was surrounded
he felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him and that its mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread
he knew no more for the spirit neither spoke nor moved
i am in the presence of the ghost of christmas yet to come
the spirit answered not but pointed onward with its hand
you are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened but will happen in the time before us scrooge pursued
is that so
the upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its folds as if the spirit had inclined its head
that was the only answer he received
although well used to ghostly company by this time scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him and he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it
the spirit paused a moment as observing his condition and giving him time to recover
but scrooge was all the worse for this
ghost of the future
he exclaimed i fear you more than any spectre
i have seen
but as i know your purpose is to do me good and as i hope to live to be another man from what i was i am prepared to bear your company and do it with a thankful heart
will you not speak to me
it gave him no reply
the hand was pointed straight before them
said scrooge
the night is waning fast and it is precious time to me i know
lead on spirit
the phantom moved away as it had come towards him
scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress which bore him up he thought and carried him along
they scarcely seemed to enter the city for the city rather seemed to spring up about them and encompass them of its own act
the spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men
observing that the hand was pointed to them scrooge advanced to listen to their talk
no said a great fat man with a monstrous chin i dont know much about it either way
i only know hes dead
when did he die
inquired another
last night i believe
why what was the matter with him
asked a third taking a vast quantity of snuff out of a very large snuffbox
i thought hed never die
god knows said the first with a yawn
what has he done with his money
asked a redfaced gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his nose that shook like the gills of a turkeycock
i havent heard said the man with the large chin yawning again
left it to his company perhaps
he hasnt left it to me
this pleasantry was received with a general laugh
its likely to be a very cheap funeral said the same speaker for upon my life i dont know of anybody to go to it
suppose we make up a party and volunteer
i dont mind going if a lunch is provided observed the gentleman with the excrescence on his nose
but i must be fed if i make one
another laugh
illustration how are you
how are you
returned the other
said the first
old scratch has got his own at last hey
well i am the most disinterested among you after all said the first speaker for i never wear black gloves and i never eat lunch
but ill offer to go if anybody else will
when i come to think of it im not at all sure that i wasnt his most particular friend for we used to stop and speak whenever we met
speakers and listeners strolled away and mixed with other groups
scrooge knew the men and looked towards the spirit for an explanation
the phantom glided on into a street
its finger pointed to two persons meeting
scrooge listened again thinking that the explanation might lie here
he knew these men also perfectly
they were men of business very wealthy and of great importance
he had made a point always of standing well in their esteem in a business point of view that is strictly in a business point of view
how are you
how are you
returned the other
said the first old scratch has got his own at last hey
so i am told returned the second
cold isnt it
seasonable for christmastime
you are not a skater i suppose
something else to think of
goodmorning
not another word
that was their meeting their conversation and their parting
they could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the death of jacob his old partner for that was
past and this ghosts province was the future
nor could he think of any one immediately connected with himself to whom he could apply them
for he had an expectation that the conduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed and would render the solution of these riddles easy
it gave him little surprise however for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life and thought and hoped he saw his newborn resolutions carried out in this
quiet and dark beside him stood the phantom with its outstretched hand
when he roused himself from his thoughtful quest he fancied from the turn of the hand and its situation in reference to himself that the unseen eyes were looking at him keenly
it made him shudder and feel very cold
they left the busy scene and went into an obscure part of the town where scrooge had never penetrated before although he recognised its situation and its bad repute
the ways were foul and narrow the shop and houses wretched the people half naked drunken slipshod ugly
alleys and archways like so many cesspools disgorged their offences of smell and dirt and life upon the straggling streets and the whole quarter reeked with crime with filth and misery
far in this den of infamous resort there was a lowbrowed beetling shop below a penthouse roof where iron old rags bottles bones and greasy offal were bought
upon the floor within were piled up heaps of rusty keys nails chains hinges files scales weights and refuse iron of all kinds
secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags masses of corrupted fat and sepulchres of bones
scrooge and the phantom came into the presence of this man just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop
after a short period of blank astonishment in which the old man with the pipe had joined them they all three burst into a laugh
let the charwoman alone to be the first
cried she who had entered first
let the laundress alone to be the second and let the undertakers man alone to be the third
look here old joe heres a chance
if we havent all three met here without meaning it
you couldnt have met in a better place said old joe removing his pipe from his mouth
come into the parlour
you were made free of it long ago you know and the other two ant strangers
stop till i shut the door of the shop
how it skreeks
there ant such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own hinges i believe and im sure theres no such old bones here as mine
were all suitable to our calling were well matched
come into the parlour
come into the parlour
the parlour was the space behind the screen of rags
the old man raked the fire together with an old stairrod and having trimmed his smoky lamp for it was night with the stem of his pipe put it into his mouth again
what odds then
what odds mrs
said the woman
every person has a right to take care of themselves
he always did
thats true indeed
said the laundress
no man more so
why then dont stand staring as if you was afraid woman
whos the wiser
were not going to pick holes in each others coats i suppose
dilber and the man together
we should hope not
very well then
cried the woman
thats enough
whos the worse for the loss of a few things like these
not a dead man i suppose
no indeed said mrs
dilber laughing
if he wanted to keep em after he was dead a wicked old screw pursued the woman why wasnt he natural in his lifetime
if he had been hed have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with
death instead of lying gasping out his last there alone by himself
its the truest word that ever was spoke said mrs
its a judgment on him
i wish it was a little heavier judgment replied the woman and it should have been you may depend upon it if i could have laid my hands on anything else
open that bundle old joe and let me know the value of it
speak out plain
im not afraid to be the first nor afraid for them to see it
we knew pretty well that we were helping ourselves before we met here i believe
its no sin
open the bundle joe
but the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this and the man in faded black mounting the breach first produced his plunder
it was not extensive
a seal or two a pencilcase a pair of sleevebuttons and a brooch of no great value were all
thats your account said joe and i wouldnt give another sixpence if i was to be boiled for not doing it
illustration what do you call this
bedcurtains
dilber was next
sheets and towels a little wearing apparel two old fashioned silver teaspoons a pair of sugartongs and a few boots
her account was stated on the wall in the same manner
i always give too much to ladies
its a weakness of mine and thats the way i ruin myself said old joe
thats your account
if you asked me for another penny and made it an open question id repent of being so liberal and knock off halfacrown
and now undo my bundle joe said the first woman
joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it and having unfastened a great many knots dragged out a large heavy roll of some dark stuff
what do you call this
bedcurtains
returned the woman laughing and leaning forward on her crossed arms
bedcurtains
you dont mean to say you took em down rings and all with him lying there
yes i do replied the woman
you were born to make your fortune said joe and youll certainly do it
i certainly shant hold my hand when i can get anything in it by reaching it out for the sake of such a man as he was i promise you
joe returned the woman coolly
dont drop that oil upon the blankets now
his blankets
whose elses do you think
replied the woman
he isnt likely to take cold without em i dare say
i hope he didnt die of anything catching
said old joe stopping in his work and looking up
dont you be afraid of that returned the woman
i ant so fond of his company that id loiter about him for such things if he did
you may look through that shirt till your eyes ache but you wont find a hole in it nor a threadbare place
its the best he had and a fine one too
theyd have wasted it if it hadnt been for me
what do you call wasting of it
asked old joe
putting it on him to be buried in to be sure replied the woman with a laugh
somebody was fool enough to do it but i took it off again
if calico ant good enough for such a purpose it isnt good enough for anything
its quite as becoming to the body
he cant look uglier than he did in that one
scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror
laughed the same woman when old joe producing a flannel bag with money in it told out their several gains upon the ground
this is the end of it you see
he frightened every one away from him when he was alive to profit us when he was dead
said scrooge shuddering from head to foot
i see i see
the case of this unhappy man might be my own
my life tends that way now
merciful heaven what is this
the room was very dark too dark to be observed with any accuracy though scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse anxious to know what kind of room it was
a pale light rising in the outer air fell straight upon the bed and on it plundered and bereft unwatched unwept uncared for was the body of this man
scrooge glanced towards the phantom
its steady hand was pointed to the head
the cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of it the motion of a finger upon scrooges part would have disclosed the face
he thought of it felt how easy it would be to do and longed to do it but he had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the spectre at his side
oh cold cold rigid dreadful death set up thine altar here and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command for this is thy dominion
but of the loved revered and honoured head thou canst not turn one hair to thy dread purposes or make one feature odious
strike shadow strike
and see his good deeds springing from the wound to sow the world with life immortal
no voice pronounced these words in scrooges ears and yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed
he thought if this man could be raised up now what would be his foremost thoughts
avarice hard dealing griping cares
they have brought him to a rich end truly
he lay in the dark empty house with not a man a woman or a child to say he was kind to me in this or that and for the memory of one kind word i will be kind to him
a cat was tearing at the door and there was a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearthstone
what they wanted in the room of death and why they were so restless and disturbed scrooge did not dare to think
he said this is a fearful place
in leaving it i shall not leave its lesson trust me
still the ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head
i understand you scrooge returned and i would do it if i could
i have not the power spirit
i have not the power
again it seemed to look upon him
if there is any person in the town who feels emotion caused by this mans death said scrooge quite agonised show that person to me
spirit i beseech you
the phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment like a wing and withdrawing it revealed a room by daylight where a mother and her children were
at length the longexpected knock was heard
she hurried to the door and met her husband a man whose face was careworn and depressed though he was young
there was a remarkable expression in it now a kind of serious delight of which he felt ashamed and which he struggled to repress
he sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire and when she asked him faintly what news which was not until after a long silence he appeared embarrassed how to answer
is it good she said or bad
to help him
bad he answered
we are quite ruined
there is hope yet caroline
if he relents she said amazed there is
nothing is past hope if such a miracle has happened
he is past relenting said her husband
he is dead
she was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke truth but she was thankful in her soul to hear it and she said so with clasped hands
she prayed forgiveness the next moment and was sorry but the first was the emotion of her heart
what the halfdrunken woman whom i told you of last night said to me when i tried to see him and obtain a weeks delayand what i thought was a mere excuse to avoid meturns out to have been quite true
he was not only very ill but dying then
to whom will our debt be transferred
i dont know
but before that time we shall be ready with the money and even though we were not it would be bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his successor
we may sleep tonight with light hearts caroline
soften it as they would their hearts were lighter
the childrens faces hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little understood were brighter and it was a happier house for this mans death
the only emotion that the ghost could show him caused by the event was one of pleasure
let me see some tenderness connected with a death said scrooge or that dark chamber spirit which we left just now will be for ever present to me
the ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet and as they went along scrooge looked here and there to find himself but nowhere was he to be seen
they entered poor bob cratchits house the dwelling he had visited before and found the mother and the children seated round the fire
very quiet
the noisy little cratchits were as still as statues in one corner and sat looking up at peter who had a book before him
the mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing
but surely they were very quiet
and he took a child and set him in the midst of them
where had scrooge heard those words
he had not dreamed them
the boy must have read them out as he and the spirit crossed the threshold
why did he not go on
the mother laid her work upon the table and put her hand up to her face
the colour hurts my eyes she said
the colour
ah poor tiny tim
theyre better now again said cratchits wife
it makes them weak by candlelight and i wouldnt show weak eyes to your father when he comes home for the world
it must be near his time
past it rather peter answered shutting up his book
but i think he has walked a little slower than he used these few last evenings mother
they were very quiet again
at last she said and in a steady cheerful voice that only faltered once i have known him walk withi have known him walk with tiny tim upon his shoulder very fast indeed
and so have i cried peter
and so have i exclaimed another
so had all
but he was very light to carry she resumed intent upon her work and his father loved him so that it was no trouble no trouble
and there is your father at the door
she hurried out to meet him and little bob in his comforterhe had need of it poor fellowcame in
his tea was ready for him on the hob and they all tried who should help him to it most
then the two young
cratchits got upon his knees and laid each child a little cheek against his face as if they said dont mind it father
dont be grieved
bob was very cheerful with them and spoke pleasantly to all the family
he looked at the work upon the table and praised the industry and speed of mrs
cratchit and the girls
they would be done long before sunday he said
you went today then robert
said his wife
yes my dear returned bob
i wish you could have gone
it would have done you good to see how green a place it is
but youll see it often
i promised him that i would walk there on a sunday
my little little child
my little child
he broke down all at once
he couldnt help it
if he could have helped it he and his child would have been farther apart perhaps than they were
he left the room and went upstairs into the room above which was lighted cheerfully and hung with christmas
there was a chair set close beside the child and there were signs of some one having been there lately
poor bob sat down in it and when he had thought a little and composed himself he kissed the little face
he was reconciled to what had happened and went down again quite happy
they drew about the fire and talked the girls and mother working still
bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of mr
on which said bob for he is the pleasantestspoken gentleman you ever heard i told him
i am heartily sorry for it mr
cratchit he said and heartily sorry for your good wife
bythebye how he ever knew that i dont know
knew what my dear
why that you were a good wife replied bob
everybody knows that said peter
very well observed my boy
i hope they do
heartily sorry he said for your good wife
if i can be of service to you in any way he said giving me his card thats where i live
pray come to me
now it wasnt cried bob for the sake of anything he might be able to do for us so much as for his kind way that this was quite delightful
it really seemed as if he had known our tiny tim and felt with us
im sure hes a good soul
you would be sure of it my dear returned bob if you saw and spoke to him
i shouldnt be at all surprisedmark what i say
peter a better situation
only hear that peter said mrs
and then cried one of the girls peter will be keeping company with some one and setting up for himself
get along with you
retorted peter grinning
its just as likely as not said bob one of these days though theres plenty of time for that my dear
but however and whenever we part from one another i am sure we shall none of us forget poor tiny
timshall weor this first parting that there was among us
never father
cried they all
no never father
they all cried again
i am very happy said little bob i am very happy
cratchit kissed him his daughters kissed him the two young
cratchits kissed him and peter and himself shook hands
spirit of tiny
tim thy childish essence was from god
spectre said scrooge something informs me that our parting moment is at hand
i know it but i know not how
tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead
indeed the spirit did not stay for anything but went straight on as to the end just now desired until besought by scrooge to tarry for a moment
this court said scrooge through which we hurry now is where my place of occupation is and has been for a length of time
i see the house
let me behold what i shall be in days to come
the spirit stopped the hand was pointed elsewhere
the house is yonder scrooge exclaimed
why do you point away
the inexorable finger underwent no change
scrooge hastened to the window of his office and looked in
it was an office still but not his
the furniture was not the same and the figure in the chair was not himself
the phantom pointed as before
he joined it once again and wondering why and whither he had gone accompanied it until they reached an iron gate
he paused to look round before entering
a churchyard
here then the wretched man whose name he had now to learn lay underneath the ground
it was a worthy place
walled in by houses overrun by grass and weeds the growth of vegetations death not life choked up with too much burying fat with repleted appetite
a worthy place
the spirit stood among the graves and pointed down to one
he advanced towards it trembling
the phantom was exactly as it had been but he dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape
before i draw nearer to that stone to which you point said scrooge answer me one question
are these the shadows of the things that will be or are they shadows of the things that may be only
still the ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood
mens courses will foreshadow certain ends to which if persevered in they must lead said scrooge
but if the courses be departed from the ends will change
say it is thus with what you show me
the spirit was immovable as ever
scrooge crept towards it trembling as he went and following the finger read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name
ebenezer scrooge
am i that man who lay upon the bed
he cried upon his knees
the finger pointed from the grave to him and back again
the finger still was there
he cried tight clutching at its robe hear me
i am not the man i was
i will not be the man i must have been but for this intercourse
why show me this if i am past all hope
for the first time the hand appeared to shake
good spirit he pursued as down upon the ground he fell before it your nature intercedes for me and pities me
assure me that i yet may change these shadows you have shown me by an altered life
the kind hand trembled
i will honour christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year
i will live in the past the present and the future
the spirits of all
three shall strive within me
i will not shut out the lessons that they teach
oh tell me i may sponge away the writing on this stone
in his agony he caught the spectral hand
it sought to free itself but he was strong in his entreaty and detained it
the spirit stronger yet repulsed him
holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed he saw an alteration in the phantoms hood and dress
it shrunk collapsed and dwindled down into a bedpost
stave five illustration
the end of it
and the bedpost was his own
the bed was his own the room was his own
best and happiest of all the time before him was his own to make amends in
i will live in the past the present and the future
scrooge repeated as he scrambled out of bed
the spirits of all three shall strive within me
o jacob marley
heaven and the christmas time be praised for this
i say it on my knees old jacob on my knees
he was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his call
he had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the spirit and his face was wet with tears
they are not torn down cried scrooge folding one of his bedcurtains in his arms they are not torn down rings and all
they are herei am herethe shadows of the things that would have been may be dispelled
they will be
i know they will
his hands were busy with his garments all this time turning them inside out putting them on upside down tearing them mislaying them making them parties to every kind of extravagance
i dont know what to do
cried scrooge laughing and crying in the same breath and making a perfect laocoon of himself with his stockings
i am as light as a feather i am as happy as an angel i am as merry as a schoolboy i am as giddy as a drunken man
a merry christmas to everybody
a happy new year to all the world
hallo here
he had frisked into the sittingroom and was now standing there perfectly winded
theres the saucepan that the gruel was in
cried scrooge starting off again and going round the fireplace
theres the door by which the
ghost of jacob marley entered
theres the corner where the ghost of
christmas present sat
theres the window where i saw the wandering
its all right its all true it all happened
really for a man who had been out of practice for so many years it was a splendid laugh a most illustrious laugh
the father of a long long line of brilliant laughs
i dont know what day of the month it is said scrooge
i dont know how long i have been among the spirits
i dont know anything
im quite a baby
never mind
i dont care
id rather be a baby
hallo here
he was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the lustiest peals he had ever heard
clash clash hammer ding dong bell
bell dong ding hammer clash clash
oh glorious glorious
running to the window he opened it and put out his head
no fog no mist clear bright jovial stirring cold cold piping for the blood to dance to golden sunlight heavenly sky sweet fresh air merry bells
oh glorious
whats today
cried scrooge calling downward to a boy in sunday clothes who perhaps had loitered in to look about him
returned the boy with all his might of wonder
whats today my fine fellow
said scrooge
replied the boy
why christmas day
its christmas day
said scrooge to himself
i havent missed it
spirits have done it all in one night
they can do anything they like
of course they can
of course they can
hallo my fine fellow
returned the boy
do you know the poulterers in the next street but one at the corner
scrooge inquired
i should hope i did replied the lad
an intelligent boy
said scrooge
a remarkable boy
do you know whether theyve sold the prize turkey that was hanging up there
not the little prize turkey the big one
the one as big as me
returned the boy
what a delightful boy
said scrooge
its a pleasure to talk to him
yes my buck
its hanging there now replied the boy
said scrooge
go and buy it
exclaimed the boy
no no said scrooge
i am in earnest
go and buy it and tell em to bring it here that i may give them the directions where to take it
come back with the man and ill give you a shilling
come back with him in less than five minutes and ill give you halfacrown
the boy was off like a shot
he must have had a steady hand at a trigger who could have got a shot off half as fast
ill send it to bob cratchits whispered scrooge rubbing his hands and splitting with a laugh
he shant know who sends it
its twice the size of tiny tim
joe miller never made such a joke as sending it to
bobs will be
the hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one but write it he did somehow and went downstairs to open the streetdoor ready for the coming of the poulterers man
as he stood there waiting his arrival the knocker caught his eye
i shall love it as long as i live
cried scrooge patting it with his hand
i scarcely ever looked at it before
what an honest expression it has in its face
its a wonderful knocker
heres the turkey
how are you
merry christmas
it was a turkey
he never could have stood upon his legs that bird
he would have snapped em short off in a minute like sticks of sealingwax
why its impossible to carry that to camden town said scrooge
you must have a cab
shaving was not an easy task for his hand continued to shake very much and shaving requires attention even when you dont dance while you are at it
but if he had cut the end of his nose off he would have put a piece of stickingplaster over it and been quite satisfied
he dressed himself all in his best and at last got out into the streets
the people were by this time pouring forth as he had seen them with the ghost of christmas present and walking with his hands behind him scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile
he looked so irresistibly pleasant in a word that three or four goodhumoured fellows said goodmorning sir
a merry christmas to you
and scrooge said often afterwards that of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard those were the blithest in his ears
he had not gone far when coming on towards him he beheld the portly gentleman who had walked into his countinghouse the day before and said scrooge and marleys i believe
it sent a pang across his heart to think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met but he knew what path lay straight before him and he took it
my dear sir said scrooge quickening his pace and taking the old gentleman by both his hands how do you do
i hope you succeeded yesterday
it was very kind of you
a merry christmas to you sir
yes said scrooge
that is my name and i fear it may not be pleasant to you
allow me to ask your pardon
and will you have the goodness
here scrooge whispered in his ear
lord bless me
cried the gentleman as if his breath were taken away
my dear mr
scrooge are you serious
if you please said scrooge
not a farthing less
a great many backpayments are included in it i assure you
will you do me that favour
my dear sir said the other shaking hands with him i dont know what to say to such munifi dont say anything please retorted scrooge
come and see me
will you come and see me
cried the old gentleman
and it was clear he meant to do it
thankee said scrooge
i am much obliged to you
i thank you fifty times
he had never dreamed that any walkthat anythingcould give him so much happiness
in the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephews house
he passed the door a dozen times before he had the courage to go up and knock
but he made a dash and did it
is your master at home my dear
said scrooge to the girl
where is he my love
said scrooge
hes in the diningroom sir along with mistress
ill show you upstairs if you please
he knows me said scrooge with his hand already on the diningroom lock
ill go in here my dear
he turned it gently and sidled his face in round the door
they were looking at the table which was spread out in great array for these young housekeepers are always nervous on such points and like to see that everything is right
said scrooge
dear heart alive how his niece by marriage started
scrooge had forgotten for the moment about her sitting in the corner with the footstool or he wouldnt have done it on any account
why bless my soul
cried fred whos that
illustration its i your uncle scrooge
i have come to dinner
will you let me in fred
your uncle scrooge
i have come to dinner
will you let me in
let him in
it is a mercy he didnt shake his arm off
he was at home in five minutes
nothing could be heartier
his niece looked just the same
so did topper when he came
so did the plump sister when she came
so did every one when they came
wonderful party wonderful games wonderful unanimity wonderful happiness
but he was early at the office next morning
oh he was early there
if he could only be there first and catch bob cratchit coming late
that was the thing he had set his heart upon
and he did it yes he did
the clock struck nine
a quarter past
he was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time
scrooge sat with his door wide open that he might see him come into the tank
his hat was off before he opened the door his comforter too
he was on his stool in a jiffy driving away with his pen as if he were trying to overtake nine oclock
growled scrooge in his accustomed voice as near as he could feign it
what do you mean by coming here at this time of day
i am very sorry sir said bob
i am behind my time
repeated scrooge
yes i think you are
step this way sir if you please
its only once a year sir pleaded bob appearing from the tank
it shall not be repeated
i was making rather merry yesterday sir
now ill tell you what my friend said scrooge
i am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer
and therefore he continued leaping from his stool and giving bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into the tank againand therefore i am about to raise your salary
bob trembled and got a little nearer to the ruler
he had a momentary idea of knocking scrooge down with it holding him and calling to the people in the court for help and a straitwaistcoat
a merry christmas bob
said scrooge with an earnestness that could not be mistaken as he clapped him on the back
a merrier christmas
bob my good fellow than i have given you for many a year
ill raise your salary and endeavour to assist your struggling family and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon over a christmas bowl of smoking bishop bob
make up the fires and buy another coalscuttle before you dot another i bob cratchit
illustration now ill tell you what my friend said scrooge
i am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer
scrooge was better than his word
he did it all and infinitely more and to tiny tim who did not die he was a second father
he became as good a friend as good a master and as good a man as the good old
city knew or any other good old city town or borough in the good old world
his own heart laughed and that was quite enough for him
he had no further intercourse with spirits but lived upon the
totalabstinence principle ever afterwards and it was always said of him that he knew how to keep christmas well if any man alive possessed the knowledge
may that be truly said of us and all of us
tiny tim observed god bless us every one
