go to clara heidi till the carriage comes mr
sesemann said kindly
heidi had been wishing to go and now she ran to claras room where a huge trunk was standing
heidi look at the things i had packed for you
do you like them
clara asked
there were a great many lovely things in it but heidi jumped for joy when she discovered a little basket with twelve round white rolls for the grandmother
the children had forgotten that the moment for parting had come when the carriage was announced
heidi had to get all her own treasures from her room yet
the grandmamas book was carefully packed and the red shawl that miss rottenmeier had purposely left behind
then putting on her pretty hat she left her room to say goodbye to clara
there was not much time left to do so for mr
sesemann was waiting to put heidi in the carriage
rottenmeier who was standing on the stairs to bid farewell to her pupil saw the red bundle in heidis hand she seized it and threw it on the ground
heidi looked imploringly at her kind protector and mr
sesemann seeing how much she treasured it gave it back to her
the happy child at parting thanked him for all his goodness
she also sent a message of thanks to the good old doctor whom she suspected to be the real cause of her going
while heidi was being lifted into the carriage mr
sesemann assured her that clara and he would never forget her
sebastian followed with
heidis basket and a large bag with provisions
sesemann called out happy journey
and the carriage rolled away
only when heidi was sitting in the train did she become conscious of where she was going
she knew now that she would really see her grandfather and the grandmother again also peter and the goats
her only fear was that the poor blind grandmother might have died while she was away
the thing she looked forward to most was giving the soft white rolls to the grandmother
while she was musing over all these things she fell asleep
in basle she was roused by sebastian for there they were to spend the night
the next morning they started off again and it took them many hours before they reached mayenfeld
when sebastian stood on the platform of the station he wished he could have travelled further in the train rather than have to climb a mountain
the last part of the trip might be dangerous for everything seemed halfwild in this country
looking round he discovered a small wagon with a lean horse
a broadshouldered man was just loading up large bags which had come by the train
sebastian approaching the man asked some information concerning the least dangerous ascent to the alp
after a while it was settled that the man should take heidi and her trunk to the village and see to it that somebody would go up with her from there
not a word had escaped heidi until she now said i can go up alone from the village
i know the road
sebastian felt relieved and calling heidi to him presented her with a heavy roll of bills and a letter for the grandfather
these precious things were put at the bottom of the basket under the rolls so that they could not possibly get lost
heidi promised to be careful of them and was lifted up to the cart
the two old friends shook hands and parted and sebastian with a slightly bad conscience for having deserted the child so soon sat down on the station to wait for a returning train
the driver was no other than the village baker who had never seen
heidi but had heard a great deal about her
he had known her parents and immediately guessed she was the child who had lived with the
curious to know why she came home again he began a conversation
are you heidi the child who lived with the almuncle
why are you coming home again
did you get on badly
oh no nobody could have got on better than i did in frankfurt
then why are you coming back
because mr
sesemann let me come
why didnt you stay
because i would rather be with my grandfather on the alp than anywhere on earth
you may think differently when you get there muttered the baker
it is strange though for she must know he said to himself
they conversed no more and heidi began to tremble with excitement when she recognized all the trees on the road and the lofty peaks of the mountains
sometimes she felt as if she could not sit still any longer but had to jump down and run with all her might
they arrived at the village at the stroke of five
immediately a large group of women and children surrounded the cart for the trunk and the little passenger had attracted everybodys notice
when heidi had been lifted down she found herself held and questioned on all sides
but when they saw how frightened she was they let her go at last
the baker had to tell of heidis arrival with the strange gentleman and assured all the people that heidi loved her grandfather with all her heart let the people say what they would about him
heidi in the meantime was running up the path from time to time she was obliged to stop for her basket was heavy and she lost her breath
her one idea was if only grandmother still sits in her corner by her spinning wheel
oh if she should have died
when the child caught sight of the hut at last her heart began to beat
the quicker she ran the more it beat but at last she tremblingly opened the door
she ran into the middle of the room unable to utter one tone she was so out of breath
oh god it sounded from one corner our heidi used to come in like that
oh if i just could have her again with me before i die
who has come
grandmother here i am
shouted the child throwing herself on her knees before the old woman
she seized her hands and arms and snuggling up to her did not for joy utter one more word
the grandmother had been so surprised that she could only silently caress the childs curly hair over and over again
yes yes she said at last this is heidis hair and her beloved voice
oh my god i thank
thee for this happiness
out of her blind eyes big tears of joy fell down on heidis hand
is it really you heidi
have you really come again
yes yes grandmother the child replied
you must not cry for i have come and will never leave you any more
now you wont have to eat hard black bread any more for a little while
look what i have brought you
heidi put one roll after another into the grandmothers lap
ah child what a blessing you bring to me
the old woman cried
but you are my greatest blessing yourself heidi
then caressing the childs hair and flushed cheeks she entreated just say one more word that i may hear your voice
while heidi was talking peters mother arrived and exclaimed in her amazement surely this is heidi
but how can that be
the child rose to shake hands with brigida who could not get over
heidis splendid frock and hat
you can have my hat i dont want it any more i have my old one still heidi said pulling out her old crushed straw hat
heidi had remembered her grandfathers words to deta about her feather hat that was why she had kept her old hat so carefully
brigida at last accepted the gift after a great many remonstrances
suddenly heidi took off her pretty dress and tied her old shawl about her
taking the grandmothers hand she said goodbye i must go home to grandfather now but i shall come again tomorrow
goodnight grandmother
oh please come again tomorrow heidi implored the old woman while she held her fast
why did you take your pretty dress off
asked brigida
id rather go to grandfather that way or else he might not know me any more the way you did
brigida accompanied the child outside and said mysteriously he would have known you in your frock you ought to have kept it on
please be careful child for peter tells us that the uncle never says a word to anyone and always seems so angry
but heidi was unconcerned and saying goodnight climbed up the path with the basket on her arm
the evening sun was shining down on the grass before her
every few minutes heidi stood still to look at the mountains behind her
suddenly she looked back and beheld such glory as she had not even seen in her most vivid dream
the rocky peaks were flaming in the brilliant light the snowfields glowed and rosy clouds were floating overhead
the grass was like an expanse of gold and below her the valley swam in golden mist
the child stood still and in her joy and transport tears ran down her cheeks
she folded her hands and looking up to heaven thanked the lord that he had brought her home again
she thanked him for restoring her to her beloved mountainsin her happiness she could hardly find words to pray
only when the glow had subsided was heidi able to follow the path again
illustration throwing herself in her grandfathers arms she held
she climbed so fast that she could soon discover first the treetops then the roof finally the hut
now she could see her grandfather sitting on his bench smoking a pipe
above the cottage the firtrees gently swayed and rustled in the evening breeze
at last she had reached the hut and throwing herself in her grandfathers arms she hugged him and held him tight
she could say nothing but grandfather
grandfather
grandfather
in her agitation
the old man said nothing either but his eyes were moist and loosening heidis arms at last he sat her on his knee
when he had looked at her a while he said so you have come home again heidi
you certainly do not look very cityfied
did they send you away
oh no you must not think that grandfather
they all were so good to me clara mr
sesemann and grandmama
but grandfather sometimes i felt as if i could not bear it any longer to be away from you
i thought i should choke i could not tell any one for that would have been ungrateful
suddenly one morning mr
this belongs to you he said laying the roll beside him
having read the letter he put it in his pocket
do you think you can still drink milk with me heidi
he asked while he stepped into the cottage
take your money with you you can buy a bed for it and clothes for many years
i dont need it at all grandfather heidi assured him i have a bed and clara has given me so many dresses that i shant need any more all my life
take it and put it in the cupboard for you will need it some day
heidi obeyed and danced around the hut in her delight to see all the beloved things again
running up to the loft she exclaimed in great disappointment oh grandfather my bed is gone
it will come again the grandfather called up from below how could
i know that you were coming back
get your milk now
heidi coming down took her old seat
she seized her bowl and emptied it eagerly as if it was the most wonderful thing she had ever tasted
grandfather our milk is the best in all the world
suddenly heidi hearing a shrill whistle rushed outside as peter and all his goats came racing down
heidi greeted the boy who stopped rooted to the spot staring at her
then she ran into the midst of her beloved friends who had not forgotten her either
schwnli and brli bleated for joy and all her other favorites pressed near to her
heidi was beside herself with joy and caressed little snowhopper and patted thistlefinch till she felt herself pushed to and fro among them
peter why dont you come down and say goodnight to me
heidi called to the boy
have you come again
he exclaimed at last
then he took heidis proffered hand and asked her as if she had been always there are you coming up with me tomorrow
no tomorrow i must go to grandmother but perhaps the day after
peter had a hard time with his goats that day for they would not follow him
over and over again they came back to heidi till she entered the shed with brli and schwnli and shut the door
about ten times that night the grandfather rose from his couch to listen to heidis quiet breathing
the window was filled up with hay for from now on the moon was not allowed to shine on heidi any more
but heidi slept quietly for she had seen the flaming mountains and had heard the firtrees roar
on sunday when the church bells ring
heidi was standing under the swaying firtrees waiting for her grandfather to join her
he had promised to bring up her trunk from the village while she went in to visit the grandmother
the child was longing to see the blind woman again and to hear how she had liked the rolls
it was saturday and the grandfather had been cleaning the cottage
soon he was ready to start
when they had descended and heidi entered peters hut the grandmother called lovingly to her have you come again child
she took hold of heidis hand and held it tight
grandmother then told the little visitor how good the rolls had tasted and how much stronger she felt already
brigida related further that the grandmother had only eaten a single roll being so afraid to finish them too soon
heidi had listened attentively and said now grandmother i know what i shall do
i am going to write to clara and shell surely send me a whole lot more
but brigida remarked that is meant well but they get hard so soon
if i only had a few extra pennies i could buy some from our baker
he makes them too but i am hardly able to pay for the black bread
heidis face suddenly shone
oh grandmother i have an awful lot of money she cried
now i know what ill do with it
every day you must have a fresh roll and two on sundays
peter can bring them up from the village
no no child the grandmother implored
that must not be
you must give it to grandfather and hell tell you what to do with it
but heidi did not listen but jumped gaily about the little room calling over and over again now grandmother can have a roll every day
shell get well and strong and she called with fresh delight maybe your eyes will see again too when you are strong and well
the grandmother remained silent not to mar the happiness of the child
seeing the old hymnbook on the shelf heidi said grandmother shall i read you a song from your book now
i can read quite nicely
she added after a pause
oh yes i wish you would child
can you really read
heidi climbing on a chair took down the dusty book from a shelf
after she had carefully wiped it off she sat down on a stool
what shall i read grandmother
whatever you want to was the reply
turning the pages heidi found a song about the sun and decided to read that aloud
more and more eagerly she read while the grandmother with folded arms sat in her chair
an expression of indescribable happiness shone in her countenance though tears were rolling down her cheeks
when heidi had repeated the end of the song a number of times the old woman exclaimed oh heidi everything seems bright to me again and my heart is light
thank you child you have done me so much good
heidi looked enraptured at the grandmothers face which had changed from an old sorrowful expression to a joyous one
she seemed to look up gratefully as if she could already behold the lovely celestial gardens told of in the hymn
soon the grandfather knocked on the window for it was time to go
brigida urged heidi to take her dress along and with it on her arm the child joined the old man and immediately told him what had happened
on hearing of her plan to purchase rolls for the grandmother every day the grandfather reluctantly consented
at this the child gave a bound shouting oh grandfather now grandmother wont ever have to eat hard black bread any more
oh everything is so wonderful now
if god our father had done immediately what i prayed for i should have come home at once and could not have brought half as many rolls to grandmother
i should not have been able to read either
grandmama told me that god would make everything much better than i could ever dream
i shall always pray from now on the way grandmama taught me
when god does not give me something i pray for i shall always remember how everything has worked out for the best this time
well pray every day grandfather wont we for otherwise god might forget us
and if somebody should forget to do it
murmured the old man
oh hell get on badly for god will forget him too
if he is unhappy and wretched people dont pity him for they will say he went away from god and now the lord who alone can help him has no pity on him
is that true heidi
who told you so
grandmama explained it all to me
after a pause the grandfather said yes but if it has happened then there is no help nobody can come back to the lord when god has once forgotten him
but grandfather everybody can come back to him grandmama told me that and besides there is the beautiful story in my book
oh grandfather you dont know it yet and i shall read it to you as soon as we get home
the grandfather had brought a big basket with him in which he carried half the contents of heidis trunk it had been too large to be conveyed up the steep ascent
arriving at the hut and setting down his load he had to sit beside heidi who was ready to begin the tale
with great animation heidi read the story of the prodigal son who was happy at home with his fathers cows and sheep
the picture showed him leaning on his staff watching the sunset
suddenly he wanted to have his own inheritance and be able to be his own master
demanding the money from his father he went away and squandered all
often he would think what a good home he had left and when he remembered how good his father had been to him and his own ungratefulness he would cry from repentance and longing
then he said to himself i shall go to my father and ask his forgiveness
when he approached his former home his father came out to meet him what do you think will happen now
heidi asked
you think that the father is angry and will say didnt i tell you
but just listen and his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck
and the son said father i have sinned against heaven and in
thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son
and they began to be merry
isnt it a beautiful story grandfather
asked heidi when he sat silently beside her
yes heidi it is said the grandfather but so seriously that heidi quietly looked at the pictures
look how happy he is she said pointing to it
a few hours later when heidi was sleeping soundly the old man climbed up the ladder
placing a little lamp beside the sleeping child he watched her a long long time
her little hands were folded and her rosy face looked confident and peaceful
the old man now folded his hands and said in a low voice while big tears rolled down his cheeks father i have sinned against heaven and thee and am no more worthy to be thy son
the next morning found the uncle standing before the door looking about him over valley and mountain
a few early bells sounded from below and the birds sang their morning anthems
reentering the house he called heidi get up
the sun is shining
put on a pretty dress for we are going to church
that was a new call and heidi obeyed quickly
when the child came downstairs in her smart little frock she opened her eyes wide
oh grandfather
she exclaimed i have never seen you in your sunday coat with the silver buttons
oh how fine you look
the old man turning to the child said with a smile you look nice too come now
with heidis hand in his they wandered down together
the nearer they came to the village the louder and richer the bells resounded
oh grandfather do you hear it
it seems like a big high feast said heidi
when they entered the church all the people were singing
though they sat down on the last bench behind the people had noticed their presence and whispered it from ear to ear
when the pastor began to preach his words were a loud thanksgiving that moved all his hearers
after the service the old man and the child walked to the parsonage
the clergyman had opened the door and received them with friendly words
i have come to ask your forgiveness for my harsh words said the uncle
i want to follow your advice to spend the winter here among you
if the people look at me askance i cant expect any better
i am sure mr
pastor you will not do so
illustration with heidis hand in his they wandered down together
the pastors friendly eyes sparkled and with many a kind word he commended the uncle for this change and putting his hand on heidis curly hair ushered them out
thus the people who had been all talking together about this great event could see that their clergyman shook hands with the old man
the door of the parsonage was hardly shut when the whole assembly came forward with outstretched hands and friendly greetings
great seemed to be their joy at the old mans resolution some of the people even accompanied him on his homeward way
when they had parted at last the uncle looked after them with his face shining as with an inward light
heidi looked up to him and said grandfather you have never looked so beautiful
do you think so child
he said with a smile
you see heidi i am more happy than i deserve to be at peace with god and men makes ones heart feel light
god has been good to me to send you back
when they arrived at peters hut the grandfather opened the door and entered
how do you do grandmother he called out
i think we must start to mend again before the fall wind comes
oh my god the uncle
exclaimed the grandmother in joyous surprise
how happy i am to be able to thank you for what you have done uncle
thank you god bless you for it
with trembling joy the grandmother shook hands with her old friend
there is something else i want to say to you uncle she continued
if i have ever hurt you in any way do not punish me
do not let
heidi go away again before i die
i cannot tell you what heidi means to me
so saying she held the clinging child to her
no danger of that grandmother i hope we shall all stay together now for many years to come
brigida now showed heidis feather hat to the old man and asked him to take it back
but the uncle asked her to keep it since heidi had given it to her
what blessings this child has brought from frankfurt brigida said
i often wondered if i should not send our little peter too
what do you think uncle
the uncles eyes sparkled with fun when he replied i am sure it would not hurt peter nevertheless i should wait for a fitting occasion before i sent him
the next moment peter himself arrived in great haste
he had a letter for heidi which had been given to him in the village
what an event a letter for heidi
they all sat down at the table while the child read it aloud
the letter was from clara sesemann who wrote that everything had got so dull since heidi left
she said that she could not stand it very long and therefore her father had promised to take her to ragatz this coming fall
she announced that grandmama was coming too for she wanted to see heidi and her grandfather
grandmama having heard about the rolls was sending some coffee too so that the grandmother would not have to eat them dry
grandmama also insisted on being taken to the grandmother herself when she came on her visit
great was the delight caused by this news and what with all the questions and plans that followed the grandfather himself forgot how late it was
i hope youll come soon again uncle
i am counting on the child for tomorrow
this promise was given
while heidi and her grandfather were on their homeward path the peaceful sound of evening bells accompanied them
at last they reached the cottage which seemed to glow in the evening light
heidi makes use of her experience illustration
preparations for a journey
the kind doctor who had sent heidi home to her beloved mountains was approaching the sesemann residence on a sunny day in september
everything about him was bright and cheerful but the doctor did not even raise his eyes from the pavement to the blue sky above
his face was sad and his hair had turned very gray since spring
a few months ago the doctor had lost his only daughter who had lived with him since his wifes early death
the blooming girl had been his only joy and since she had gone from him the evercheerful doctor was bowed down with grief
when sebastian opened the door to the physician he bowed very low for the doctor made friends wherever he went
i am glad you have come doctor mr
sesemann called to his friend as he entered
please let us talk over this trip to switzerland again
do you still give the same advice now that clara is so much better
what must i think of you sesemann
replied the doctor sitting down
i wish your mother was here
everything is clear to her and things go smoothly then
this is the third time today that you have called me and always for the same thing
it is true it must make you impatient said mr
laying his hand on his friends shoulder he continued i cannot say how hard it is for me to refuse clara this trip
havent i promised it to her and hasnt she looked forward to it for months
she has borne all her suffering so patiently just because she had hoped to be able to visit her little friend on the alp
i hate to rob her of this pleasure
the poor child has so many trials and so little change
but sesemann you must do it was the doctors answer
when his friend remained silent he continued just think what a hard summer
clara has had
she never was more ill and we could not attempt this journey without risking the worst consequences
remember we are in
september now and though the weather may still be fine on the alp it is sure to be very cool
the days are getting short and she could only spend a few hours up there if she had to return for the night
it would take several hours to have her carried up from ragatz
you see yourself how impossible it is
i shall come in with you though to talk to clara and youll find her sensible
ill tell you of my plan for next may
first she can go to ragatz to take the baths
when it gets warm on the mountain she can be carried up from time to time
shell be stronger then and much more able to enjoy those excursions than she is now
if we hope for an improvement in her condition we must be extremely cautious and careful remember that
sesemann who had been listening with the utmost submission now said anxiously doctor please tell me honestly if you still have hope left for any change
with shrugging shoulders the doctor replied not very much
but think of me sesemann
have you not a child who loves you and always welcomes you
you dont have to come back to a lonely house and sit down alone at your table
your child is well taken care of and if she has many privations she also has many advantages
sesemann you do not need to be pitied
just think of my lonely home
sesemann had gotten up and was walking round the room as he always did when something occupied his thoughts
suddenly he stood before his friend and said doctor i have an idea
i cannot see you sad any longer
you must get away
you shall undertake this trip and visit heidi in our stead
the doctor had been surprised by this proposal and tried to object
sesemann was so full of his new project that he pulled his friend with him into his daughters room not leaving him time for any remonstrances
clara loved the doctor who had always tried to cheer her up on his visits by bright and funny tales
she was sorry for the change that had come over him and would have given much to see him happy again
when he had shaken hands with her both men pulled up their chairs to claras bedside
sesemann began to speak of their journey and how sorry he was to give it up
then he quickly began to talk of his new plan
claras eyes had filled with tears
but she knew that her father did not like to see her cry and besides she was sure that her papa would only forbid her this pleasure because it was absolutely necessary to do so
then you can take all the things to her that i had planned to take myself
oh please doctor go and then ill be good and take as much codliver oil as ever you want me to
who can tell if this promise decided the doctor
at any rate he answered with a smile then i surely must go clara for you will get fat and strong as we both want to see you
have you settled yet when
oh you had better go tomorrow morning doctor clara urged
she is right the father assented the sun is shining and you must not lose any more glorious days on the alp
the doctor had to laugh
why dont you chide me for being here still
i shall go as quickly as i can sesemann
clara gave many messages to him for heidi
she also told him to be sure to observe everything closely so that he would be able to tell her all about it when he came back
the things for heidi were to be sent to him later for miss rottenmeier who had to pack them was out on one of her lengthy wanderings about town
the doctor promised to comply with all claras wishes and to start the following day
clara rang for the maid and said to her when she arrived please
tinette pack a lot of fresh soft coffeecake in this box
a box had been ready for this purpose many days
when the maid was leaving the room she murmured thats a silly bother
sebastian who had happened to overhear some remarks asked the physician when he was leaving to take his regards to the little miss as he called heidi
with a promise to deliver this message the doctor was just hastening out when he encountered an obstacle
miss rottenmeier who had been obliged to return from her walk on account of the strong wind was just coming in
she wore a large cape which the wind was blowing about her like two full sails
both had retreated politely to give way to each other
suddenly the wind seemed to carry the housekeeper straight towards the doctor who had barely time to avoid her
telling her of his intended visit he entreated her to pack the things for heidi as only she knew how
clara had expected some resistance from miss rottenmeier about the packing of her presents
what was her surprise when this lady showed herself most obliging and immediately on being told brought together all the articles
first came a heavy coat for heidi with a hood which clara meant her to use on visits to the grandmother in the winter
then came a thick warm shawl and a large box with coffeecake for the grandmother
an enormous sausage for peters mother followed and a little sack of tobacco for the grandfather
at last a lot of mysterious little parcels and boxes were packed things that clara had gathered together for heidi
when the tidy pack lay ready on the ground claras heart filled with pleasure at the thought of her little friends delight
sebastian now entered and putting the pack on his shoulder carried it to the doctors house without delay
a guest on the alp
the early dawn was tinging the mountains and a fresh morningbreeze rocked the old firtrees to and fro
heidi opened her eyes for the rustling of the wind had awakened her
these sounds always thrilled her heart and now they drew her out of bed
rising hurriedly she soon was neatly dressed and combed
coming down the little ladder and finding the grandfathers bed empty she ran outside
the old man was looking up at the sky to see what the weather was going to be like that day
rosy clouds were passing overhead but gradually the sky grew more blue and deep and soon a golden light passed over the heights for the sun was rising in all his glory
oh how lovely
goodmorning grandfather heidi exclaimed
are your eyes bright already
the grandfather retorted holding out his hand
heidi then ran over to her beloved firtrees and danced about while the wind was howling in the branches
after the old man had washed and milked the goats he brought them out of the shed
when heidi saw her friends again she caressed them tenderly and they in their turn nearly crushed her between them
sometimes when brli got too wild heidi would say but brli you push me like the big turk and that was enough to quiet the goat
soon peter arrived with the whole herd the jolly thistlefinch ahead of all the others
heidi being soon in the mist of them was pushed about among them
peter was anxious to say a word to the little girl so he gave a shrill whistle urging the goats to climb ahead
when he was near her he said reproachfully you really might come with me today
no i cant peter said heidi
they might come from frankfurt any time
i must be home when they come
how often you have said that grumbled the boy
but i mean it replied heidi
do you really think i want to be away when they come from frankfurt
do you really think that peter
they could come to uncle peter growled
then the grandfathers strong voice was heard why doesnt the army go forward
is it the fieldmarshals fault or the fault of the troop
peter immediately turned about and led his goats up the mountain without more ado
since heidi had come home again to her grandfather she did many things that had never occurred to her before
for instance she would make her bed every morning and run about the hut tidying and dusting
with an old rag she would rub the chairs and table till they all shone and the grandfather would exclaim it is always sunday with us now heidi has not been away in vain
on this day after breakfast when heidi began her selfimposed task it took her longer than usual for the weather was too glorious to stay within
over and over again a bright sunbeam would tempt the busy child outside
how could she stay indoors when the glistening sunshine was pouring down and all the mountains seemed to glow
she had to sit down on the dry hard ground and look down into the valley and all about her
then suddenly remembering her little duties she would hasten back
it was not long though till the roaring firtrees tempted her again
the grandfather had been busy in his little shop merely glancing over at the child from time to time
suddenly he heard her call oh grandfather come
he was frightened and came out quickly he saw her running down the hill crying they are coming they are coming
oh the doctor is coming first
illustration they are coming oh the doctor is coming first
when heidi at last reached her old friend he held out his hand which
heidi immediately seized
in the full joy of her heart she exclaimed how do you do doctor
and i thank you a thousand times
how are you heidi
but what are you thanking me for already
the doctor asked with a smile
because you let me come home again the child explained
the gentlemans face lit up like sunshine
he had certainly not counted on such a reception on the alp
on the contrary
not even noticing all the beauty around him he had climbed up sadly for he was sure that heidi probably would not know him any more
he thought that he would be far from welcome being obliged to cause her a great disappointment
instead he beheld heidis bright eyes looking up at him in gratefulness and love
she was still holding his arm when he said come now heidi and take me to your grandfather for i want to see where you live
like a kind father he had taken her hand but heidi stood still and looked down the mountainside
but where are clara and grandmama
child i must tell you something now which will grieve you as much as it grieves me replied the doctor
i had to come alone for clara has been very ill and could not travel
of course grandmama has not come either but the spring will soon be here and when the days get long and warm they will surely visit you
heidi was perfectly amazed she could not understand how all those things that she had pictured to herself so clearly would not happen after all
she was standing perfectly motionless confused by the blow
it was some time before heidi remembered that after all she had come down to meet the doctor
looking up at her friend she was struck by his sad and cheerless face
how changed he was since she had seen him
she did not like to see people unhappy least of all the good kind doctor
now well go to grandfather
hand in hand she climbed up with her old friend
all the way she tried to cheer him up by telling him again and again of the coming summer days
after they had reached the cottage she called out to her grandfather quite happily they are not here yet but it wont be very long before they are coming
the grandfather warmly welcomed his guest who did not seem at all a stranger for had not heidi told him many things about the doctor
they all three sat down on the bench before the door and the doctor told of the object of his visit
he whispered to the child that something was coming up the mountain very soon which would bring her more pleasure than his visit
what could it be
this plan was accepted
the sun was in its zenith and the wind had ceased
only a soft delicious breeze fanned the cheeks of all
the uncle now got up and went into the hut returning soon with a table and their dinner
go in heidi and set the table here
i hope you will excuse our simple meal he said turning to his guest
i shall gladly accept this delightful invitation i am sure that dinner will taste good up here said the guest looking down over the sunbathed valley
heidi was running to and fro for it gave her great joy to be able to wait on her kind protector
soon the uncle appeared with the steaming milk the toasted cheese and the finelysliced rosy meat that had been dried in the pure air
the doctor enjoyed his dinner better than any he had ever tasted
yes we must send clara up here
how she could gather strength
he said if she would have an appetite like mine today she couldnt help getting nice and fat
at this moment a man could be seen walking up with a large sack on his shoulders
arriving on top he threw down his load breathing in the pure fresh air
opening the cover the doctor said this has come for you from
frankfurt heidi
come and look what is in it
heidi timidly watched the heap and only when the gentleman opened the box with the cakes for the grandmother she said joyfully oh now grandmother can eat this lovely cake
she was taking the box and the beautiful shawl on her arm and was going to race down to deliver the gifts when the men persuaded her to stay and unpack the rest
what was her delight at finding the tobacco and all the other things
the men had been talking together when the child suddenly planted herself in front of them and said these things have not given me as much pleasure as the dear doctors coming
both men smiled
when it was near sunset the doctor rose to start on his way down
the grandfather carrying the box the shawl and the sausage and the guest holding the little girl by the hand they wandered down the mountainside
when they reached peters hut heidi was told to go inside and wait for her grandfather there
at parting she asked would you like to come with me up to the pasture tomorrow doctor
with pleasure
goodbye heidi was the reply
the grandfather had deposited all the presents before the door and it took heidi long to carry in the huge box and the sausage
the shawl she put on the grandmothers knee
brigida had silently watched the proceedings and could not open her eyes wide enough when she saw the enormous sausage
never in her life had she seen the like and now she really possessed it and could cut it herself
oh grandmother dont the cakes please you awfully
just look how soft they are
the child exclaimed
what was her amazement when she saw the grandmother more pleased with the shawl which would keep her warm in winter
grandmother clara has sent you that heidi said
oh what kind good people they are to think of a poor old woman like me
i never thought i should ever own such a splendid wrap
at this moment peter came stumbling in
the uncle is coming up behind me and heidi must that was as far as he got for his eyes had fastened on the sausage
heidi however had already said goodbye for she knew what he had meant
though her uncle never went by the hut any more without stepping in she knew it was too late today
heidi come you must get your sleep he called through the open door
bidding them all goodnight he took heidi by the hand and under the glistening stars they wandered home to their peaceful cottage

retaliation
early the next morning the doctor climbed up the mountain in company with peter and his goats
the friendly gentleman made several attempts to start a conversation with the boy but as answer to his questions he got nothing more than monosyllables
when they arrived on top they found heidi already waiting fresh and rosy as the early dawn
are you coming
asked peter as usual
of course i shall if the doctor comes with us replied the child
the grandfather coming out of the hut greeted the newcomer with great respect
then he went up to peter and hung on his shoulder the sack which seemed to contain more than usual that day
when they had started on their way heidi kept urging forward the goats which were crowding about her
when at last she was walking peacefully by the doctors side she began to relate to him many things about the goats and all their strange pranks and about the flowers rocks and birds they saw
when they arrived at their destination time seemed to have flown
peter all the time was sending many an angry glance at the unconscious doctor who never even noticed it
heidi now took the doctor to her favorite spot
from there they could hear the peacefulsounding bells of the grazing cattle below
the sky was deep blue and above their heads the eagle was circling with outstretched wings
everything was luminous and bright about them but the doctor had been silent
suddenly looking up he beheld heidis radiant eyes
heidi it is beautiful up here he said
but how can anybody with a heavy heart enjoy the beauty
oh exclaimed heidi one never has a sad heart here
one only gets unhappy in frankfurt
a faint smile passed over the doctors face
then he began but if somebody has brought his sorrow away with him how would you comfort him
god in heaven alone can help him
that is true child remarked the doctor
but what can we do when
god himself has sent us the affliction
after meditating a moment heidi replied one must wait patiently for god knows how to turn the saddest things to something happy in the end
god will show us what he has meant to do for us
but he will only do so if we pray to him patiently
i hope you will always keep this beautiful belief heidi said the doctor
then looking up at the mighty cliffs above he continued think how sad it would make us not to be able to see all these beautiful things
wouldnt that make us doubly sad
can you understand me child
a great pain shot through heidis breast
she had to think of the poor grandmother
her blindness was always a great sorrow to the child and she had been struck with it anew
seriously she replied oh yes i can understand it
but then we can read grandmothers songs they make us happy and bright again
which songs heidi
oh those of the sun and of the beautiful garden and then the last verses of the long one
grandmother loves them so that i always have to read them over three times said heidi
i wish you would say them to me child for i should like to hear them said the doctor
heidi folding her hands began the consoling verses
she stopped suddenly however for the doctor did not seem to listen
he was sitting motionless holding his hand before his eyes
thinking that he had fallen asleep she remained silent
but the verses had recalled his childhood days he seemed to hear his mother and see her loving eyes for when he was a little boy she had sung this song to him
a long time he sat there till he discovered that heidi was watching him
heidi your song was lovely he said with a more joyful voice
we must come here another day and then you can recite it to me again
during all this time peter had been boiling with anger
now that heidi had come again to the pasture with him she did nothing but talk to the old gentleman
it made him very cross that he was not even able to get near her
standing a little distance behind heidis friend he shook his fist at him and soon afterwards both fists finally raising them up to the sky as heidi and the doctor remained together
when the sun stood in its zenith and peter knew that it was noon he called over to them with all his might time to eat
when heidi was getting up to fetch their dinner the doctor just asked for a glass of milk which was all he wanted
the child also decided to make the milk her sole repast running over to peter and informing him of their resolution
when the boy found that the whole contents of the bag was his he hurried with his task as never in his life before
but he felt guilty on account of his former anger at the kind gentleman
to show his repentance he held his hands up flat to the sky indicating by his action that his fists did not mean anything any more
only after that did he start with his feast
heidi and the doctor had wandered about the pasture till the gentleman had found it time to go
he wanted heidi to remain where she was but she insisted on accompanying him
all the way down she showed him many places where the pretty mountain flowers grew all of whose names she could tell him
when they parted at last heidi waved to him
from time to time he turned about and seeing the child still standing there he had to think of his own little daughter who used to wave to him like that when he went away from home
the weather was warm and sunny that month
every morning the doctor came up to the alp spending his day very often with the old man
many a climb they had together that took them far up to the bare cliffs near the eagles haunt
the uncle would show his guest all the herbs that grew on hidden places and were strengthening and healing
he could tell many strange things of the beasts that lived in holes in rock or earth or in the high tops of trees
in the evening they would part and the doctor would exclaim my dear friend i never leave you without having learned something
but most of his days he spent with heidi
then the two would sit together on the childs favorite spot and peter quite subdued behind them
heidi had to recite the verses as she had done the first day and entertain him with all the things she knew
at last the beautiful month of september was over
one morning the doctor came up with a sadder face than usual
the time had come for him to go back to frankfurt and great was the uncles sadness at that news
heidi herself could hardly realize that her loving friend whom she had been seeing every day was really leaving
the doctor himself was loath to go for the alp had become as a home to him
but it was necessary for him to go and shaking hands with the grandfather he said goodbye heidi going along with him a little way
hand in hand they wandered down till the doctor stood still
then caressing heidis curly hair he said now i must go heidi
i wish i could take you along with me to frankfurt then i could keep you
at those words all the rows and rows of houses and streets miss
rottenmeier and tinette rose before heidis eyes
hesitating a little she said i should like it better if you would come to see us again
i believe that will be better
now farewell
said the friendly gentleman
when they shook hands his eyes filled with tears
turning quickly he hurried off
heidi standing on the same spot looked after him
what kind eyes he had
but they had been full of tears
all of a sudden she began to cry bitterly and ran after her friend calling with all her might but interrupted by her sobs oh doctor doctor
looking round he stood still and waited till the child had reached him
her tears came rolling down her cheeks while she sobbed ill come with you to frankfurt and ill stay as long as ever you want me to
but first i must see grandfather
no no dear child he said affectionately not at once
you must remain here i dont want you to get ill again
but if i should get sick and lonely and ask you to come to me would you come and stay with me
can i go away and think that somebody in this world still cares for me and loves me
yes i shall come to you the same day for i really love you as much as grandfather heidi assured him crying all the time
shaking hands again they parted
heidi stayed on the same spot waving her hand and looking after her departing friend till he seemed no bigger than a little dot
then he looked back a last time at heidi and the sunny alp muttering to himself it is beautiful up there
body and soul get strengthened in that place and life seems worth living again
illustration
winter in the village
the snow lay so deep around the almhut that the windows seemed to stand level with the ground and the housedoor had entirely disappeared
round peters hut it was the same
when the boy went out to shovel the snow he had to creep through the window then he would sink deep into the soft snow and kick with arms and legs to get free
taking a broom the boy would have to clear away the snow from the door to prevent its falling into the hut
the uncle had kept his word when the first snow had fallen he had moved down to the village with heidi and his goats
near the church and the parish house lay an old ruin that once had been a spacious building
a brave soldier had lived there in days gone by he had fought in the spanish war and coming back with many riches had built himself a splendid house
but having lived too long in the noisy world to be able to stand the monotonous life in the little town he soon went away never to come back
after his death many years later though the house was already beginning to decay a distant relation of his took possession of it
the new proprietor did not want to build it up again so poor people moved in
they had to pay little rent for the house which was gradually crumbling and falling to pieces
years ago when the uncle had come to the village with tobias he had lived there
most of the time it had been empty for the winter lasted long and cold winds would blow through the chinks in the walls
when poor people lived there their candles would be blown out and they would shiver with cold in the dark
but the uncle had known how to help himself
in the fall as soon as he had resolved to live in the village he came down frequently fitting up the place as best he could
on approaching the house from the back one entered an open room where nearly all the walls lay in ruins
on one side the remains of a chapel could be seen now covered with the thickest ivy
a large hall came next with a beautiful stone floor and grass growing in the crevices
most of the walls were gone and part of the ceiling also
if a few thick pillars had not been left supporting the rest it would undoubtedly have tumbled down
the uncle had made a wooden partition here for the goats and covered the floor with straw
several corridors most of them half decayed led finally to a chamber with a heavy iron door
this room was still in good condition and had dark wood panelling on the four firm walls
in one corner was an enormous stove which nearly reached up to the ceiling
on the white tiles were painted blue pictures of old towers surrounded by high trees and of hunters with their hounds
there also was a scene with a quiet lake where under shady oaktrees a fisherman was sitting
around the stove a bench was placed
heidi loved to sit there and as soon as she had entered their new abode she began to examine the pictures
arriving at the end of the bench she discovered a bed which was placed between the wall and the stove
oh grandfather i have found my bedroom exclaimed the little girl
oh how fine it is
where are you going to sleep
your bed must be near the stove to keep you warm said the old man
now come and look at mine
with that the grandfather led her into his bedroom
from there a door led into the hugest kitchen heidi had ever seen
with a great deal of trouble the grandfather had fitted up this place
many boards were nailed across the walls and the door had been fastened with heavy wires for beyond the building lay in ruins
thick underbrush was growing there sheltering thousands of insects and lizards
heidi was delighted with her new home and when peter arrived next day she did not rest till he had seen every nook and corner of the curious dwellingplace
heidi slept very well in her chimney corner but it took her many days to get accustomed to it
when she woke up in the morning and could not hear the firtrees roar she would wonder where she was
was the snow too heavy on the branches
was she away from home
but as soon as she heard her grandfathers voice outside she remembered everything and would jump merrily out of bed
after four days had gone by heidi said to her grandfather i must go to grandmother now she has been alone so many days
but the grandfather shook his head and said you cant go yet child
the snow is fathoms deep up there and is still falling
peter can hardly get through
a little girl like you would be snowed up and lost in no time
wait a while till it freezes and then you can walk on top of the crust
heidi was very sorry but she was so busy now that the days flew by
every morning and afternoon she went to school eagerly learning whatever was taught her
she hardly ever saw peter there for he did not come very often
the mild teacher would only say from time to time it seems to me peter is not here again
school would do him good but i guess there is too much snow for him to get through
but when heidi came home towards evening peter generally paid her a visit
after a few days the sun came out for a short time at noon and the next morning the whole alp glistened and shone like crystal
peter was jumping as usual into the snow that morning he fell against something hard and before he could stop himself he flew a little way down the mountain
when he had gained his feet at last he stamped upon the ground with all his might
it really was frozen as hard as stone
peter could hardly believe it and quickly running up and swallowing his milk and putting his bread in his pocket he announced i must go to school today
yes go and learn nicely answered his mother
then sitting down on his sled the boy coasted down the mountain like a shot
not being able to stop his course when he reached the village he coasted down further and further till he arrived in the plain where the sled stopped of itself
it was already late for school so the boy took his time and only arrived in the village when heidi came home for dinner
weve got it
announced the boy on entering
what general
asked the uncle
the snow peter replied
oh now i can go up to grandmother
heidi rejoiced
but peter why didnt you come to school
you could coast down today she continued reproachfully
i went too far on my sled and then it was too late peter replied
i call that deserting
said the uncle
people who do that must have their ears pulled do you hear
the boy was frightened for there was no one in the world whom he respected more than the uncle
a general like you ought to be doubly ashamed to do so the uncle went on
what would you do with the goats if they did not obey you any more
beat them was the reply
if you knew of a boy that was behaving like a disobedient goat and had to get spanked what would you say
serves him right
so now you know it goatgeneral if you miss school again when you ought to be there you can come to me and get your due
now at last peter understood what the uncle had meant
more kindly the old man then turned to peter and said come to the table now and eat with us
then you can go up with heidi and when you bring her back at night you can get your supper here
this unexpected change delighted peter
not losing any time he soon disposed of his full plate
heidi who had given the boy most of her dinner was already putting on claras new coat
then together they climbed up heidi chatting all the time
but peter did not say a single word
he was preoccupied and had not even listened to heidis tales
before they entered the hut the boy said stubbornly i think
i had rather go to school than get a beating from the uncle
heidi promptly confirmed him in his resolution
when they went into the room peters mother was alone at the table mending
the grandmother was nowhere to be seen
brigida now told
heidi that the grandmother was obliged to stay in bed on those cold days as she did not feel very strong
that was something new for
quickly running to the old womans chamber she found her lying in a narrow bed wrapped up in her grey shawl and thin blanket
thank heaven
the grandmother exclaimed when she heard her darlings step
all autumn and winter long a secret fear had been gnawing at her heart that heidi would be sent for by the strange gentleman of whom peter had told her so much
heidi had approached the bed asking anxiously are you very sick grandmother
no no child the old woman reassured her the frost has just gone into my limbs a little
are you going to be well again as soon as the warm weather comes
inquired heidi
yes yes and if god wills even sooner
i want to go back to my spinningwheel and i nearly tried it today
ill get up tomorrow though the grandmother said confidently for she had noticed how frightened heidi was
the last speech made the child feel more happy
then looking wonderingly at the grandmother she said in frankfurt people put on a shawl when they go out
why are you putting it on in bed grandmother
i put it on to keep me warm heidi
i am glad to have it for my blanket is very thin
but grandmother your bed is slanting down at your head where it ought to be high
no bed ought to be like that
i know child i can feel it well
so saying the old woman tried to change her position on the pillow that lay under her like a thin board
my pillow never was very thick and sleeping on it all these years has made it flat
oh dear if i had only asked clara to give me the bed i had in
heidi lamented
it had three big pillows on it i could hardly sleep because i kept sliding down from them all the time
could you sleep with them grandmother
of course because that would keep me warm
i could breathe so much easier too said the grandmother trying to find a higher place to lie on
but i must not talk about it any more for i have to be thankful for many things
i get the lovely roll every day and have this beautiful warm shawl
i also have you my child
heidi wouldnt you like to read me something today
heidi immediately fetched the book and read one song after another
the grandmother in the meantime was lying with folded hands her face which had been so sad a short time ago was lit up with a happy smile
suddenly heidi stopped
are you well again grandmother
i feel very much better heidi
please finish the song will you
the child obeyed and when she came to the last words when mine eyes grow dim and sad let thy love more brightly burn that my soul a wanderer glad safely homeward may return
safely homeward may return
she exclaimed oh grandmother i know what it is like to come home
after a while she said it is getting dark grandmother i must go home now
i am glad that you feel better again
illustration the two children were already flying down the alp
the grandmother holding the childs hand in hers said yes i am happy again though i have to stay in bed
nobody knows how hard it is to lie here alone day after day
i do not hear a word from anybody and cannot see a ray of sunlight
i have very sad thoughts sometimes and often i feel as if i could not bear it any longer
but when i can hear those blessed songs that you have read to me it makes me feel as if a light was shining into my heart giving me the purest joy
shaking hands the child now said goodnight and pulling peter with her ran outside
the brilliant moon was shining down on the white snow light as day
the two children were already flying down the alp like birds soaring through the air
after heidi had gone to bed that night she lay awake a little while thinking over everything the grandmother had said especially about the joy the songs had given her
if only poor grandmother could hear those comforting words every day
heidi knew that it might be a week or two again before she could repeat her visit
the child became very sad when she thought how uncomfortable and lonely the old woman would be
was there no way for help
suddenly heidi had an idea and it thrilled her so that she felt as if she could not wait till morning came to put her plan in execution
but in her excitement she had forgotten her evening prayer so sitting up in bed she prayed fervently to god
then falling back into the fragrant hay she soon slept peacefully and soundly still the bright morning came
illustration
winter still continues
peter arrived punctually at school next day
he had brought his lunch with him in a bag for all the children that came from far away ate in school while the others went home
in the evening peter as usual paid his visit to heidi
the minute he opened the door she ran up to him saying peter i have to tell you something
say it he replied
you must learn to read now said the child
i have done it already
yes yes peter but i dont mean it that way heidi eagerly proceeded you must learn so that you really know how afterwards
i cant peter remarked
nobody believes you about that any more and i wont either heidi said resolutely
when i was in frankfurt grandmama told me that it wasnt true and that i shouldnt believe you
peters astonishment was great
ill teach you for i know how when you have learnt it you must read one or two songs to grandmother every day
grumbled the boy
this obstinate refusal made heidi very angry
with flaming eyes she planted herself before the boy and said ill tell you what will happen if you dont want to learn
your mother has often said that shell send you to frankfurt
clara showed me the terrible large boys school there where youll have to go
you must stay there till you are a man peter
you mustnt think that there is only one teacher there and such a kind one as we have here
there are whole rows of them and when they are out walking they have high black hats on their heads
i saw them myself when i was out driving
cold shivers ran down peters back
yes youll have to go there and when they find out that you cant read or even spell theyll laugh at you
ill do it said peter half angry and half frightened
oh i am glad
let us start right away
said heidi joyfully pulling
peter over to the table
among the things that clara had sent heidi had found a little book with the abc and some rhymes
she had chosen this for the lessons
peter having to spell the first rhyme found great difficulty so heidi said ill read it to you and then youll be able to do it better
listen if a b c you do not know before the school board you must go
i wont go said peter stubbornly
before the court
hurry up and learn the three letters then you wont have to
peter beginning again repeated the three letters till heidi said now you know them
having observed the good result of the first rhyme she began to read again d e f you then must read or of misfortune take good heed
if hijk are forgot adversity is on the spot who over l and m doth stumble must pay a penance and feel humble
theres trouble coming if you knew youd quickly learn n o p q
if still you halt on r s t youll suffer for it speedily
heidi stopping looked at peter who was so frightened by all these threats and mysterious horrors that he sat as still as a mouse
heidis tender heart was touched and she said comfortingly dont be afraid peter if you come to me every day youll soon learn all the letters and then those things wont happen
but come every day even when it snows
peter did so and departed
obeying heidis instructions he came daily to her for his lesson
sometimes the grandfather would sit in the room smoking his pipe often the corners of his mouth would twitch as if he could hardly keep from laughing
he generally invited peter to stay to supper afterwards which liberally rewarded the boy for all his great exertions
thus the days passed by
in all this time peter had really made some progress though the rhymes still gave him difficulty
when they had come to u heidi read whoever mixes u and v will go where he wont want to be
and further if w you still ignore look at the rod beside the door
often peter would growl and object to those measures but nevertheless he kept on learning and soon had but three letters left
the next few days the following rhymes with their threats made peter more eager than ever
if you the letter x forget for you no supper will be set
if you still hesitate with y for shame youll run away and cry
when heidi read the last and he who makes his z with blots must journey to the hottentots
peter sneered nobody even knows where they are
i am sure grandfather does heidi retorted jumping up
just wait one minute and i shall ask him
he is over with the parson and with that she had opened the door
shrieked peter in great alarm for he saw himself already transported to those dreadful people
what is the matter with you
said heidi standing still
nothing but stay here
ill learn he blubbered
but heidi wanting to know something about the hottentots herself could only be kept back by piteous screams from peter
so at last they settled down again and before it was time to go peter knew the last letter and had even begun to read syllables
from this day on he progressed more quickly
it was three weeks since heidi had paid her last visit to the grandmother for much snow had fallen since
one evening peter coming home said triumphantly i can do it
what is it you can do peter
asked his mother eagerly
what is it possible
did you hear it grandmother
the grandmother also was curious to learn how this had happened
i must read a song now heidi told me to peter continued
to the womens amazement peter began
after every verse his mother would exclaim who would have ever thought it
while the grandmother remained silent
one day later when it happened that it was peters turn to read in school the teacher said peter must i pass you by again as usual
or do you want to tryi shall not say to read but to stammer through a line
peter began and read three lines without stopping
in dumb astonishment the teacher putting down his book looked at the boy
what miracle has happened to you
he exclaimed
how did this happen peter
it was heidi the boy replied
in great amazement the teacher looked at the little girl
then the kind man continued i have noticed a great change in you peter
you used to stay away from school sometimes more than a week and lately you have not even missed a day
who has brought about this change
every evening now peter on his return home read one song to his grandmother but never more
to the frequent praises of brigida the old woman once replied i am glad he has learnt something but nevertheless i am longing for the spring to come
then heidi can visit me for when she reads the verses sound so different
i cannot always follow peter and the songs dont thrill me the way they do when heidi says them
and no wonder
for peter would often leave out long and difficult wordswhat did three or four words matter
so it happened sometimes that there were hardly any nouns left in the hymns that peter read
news from distant friends
may had come
warm sunshine was bathing the whole alp in glorious light and having melted the last snow had brought the first spring flowers to the surface
a merry spring wind was blowing drying up the damp places in the shadow
high above in the azure heaven the eagle floated peacefully
heidi and her grandfather were back on the alp
the child was so happy to be home again that she jumped about among the beloved objects
here she discovered a new spring bud and there she watched the gay little gnats and beetles that were swarming in the sun
the grandfather was busy in his little shop and a sound of hammering and sawing could be heard
heidi had to go and see what the grandfather was making
there before the door stood a neat new chair while the old man was busy making a second
oh i know what they are for said heidi gaily
you are making them for clara and grandmama
oh but we need a thirdor do you think that
miss rottenmeier wont come perhaps
i really dont know said grandfather but it is safer to have a chair for her if she should come
heidi thoughtfully looking at the backless chairs remarked grandfather i dont think she would sit down on those
then we must invite her to sit down on the beautiful green lounge of grass quietly answered the old man
while heidi was still wondering what the grandfather had meant peter arrived whistling and calling
as usual heidi was soon surrounded by the goats who also seemed happy to be back on the alp
peter angrily pushing the goats aside marched up to heidi thrusting a letter into her hand
did you get a letter for me on the pasture
heidi said astonished
where did it come from
from my bag
the letter had been given to peter the previous evening putting it in his lunchbag the boy had forgotten it there till he opened the bag for his dinner
heidi immediately recognized claras handwriting and bounding over to her grandfather exclaimed a letter has come from
wouldnt you like me to read it to you grandfather
heidi immediately read to her two listeners as follows dear heidi we are all packed up and shall travel in two or three days
papa is leaving too but not with us for he has to go to paris first
the dear doctor visits us now every day and as soon as he opens the door he calls away to the alp
for he can hardly wait for us to go
if you only knew how he enjoyed being with you last fall
he came nearly every day this winter to tell us all about you and the grandfather and the mountains and the flowers he saw
he said that it was so quiet in the pure delicious air away from towns and streets that everybody has to get well there
he is much better himself since his visit and seems younger and happier
oh how i look forward to it all
the doctors advice is that i shall go to ragatz first for about six weeks then i can go to live in the village and from there i shall come to see you every fine day
grandmama who is coming with me is looking forward to the trip too
but just think miss rottenmeier does not want to go
when grandmama urges her she always declines politely
i think sebastian must have given her such a terrible description of the high rocks and fearful abysses that she is afraid
i think he told her that it was not safe for anybody and that only goats could climb such dreadful heights
she used to be so eager to go to switzerland but now neither tinette nor she wants to take the risk
i can hardly wait to see you again
goodbye dear heidi with much love from grandmama i am your true friend clara
when peter heard this he swung his rod to right and left
furiously driving the goats before him he bounded down the hill
heidi visited the grandmother next day for she had to tell her the good news
sitting up in her corner the old woman was spinning as usual
her face looked sad for peter had already announced the near visit of heidis friends and she dreaded the result
after having poured out her full heart heidi looked at the old woman
what is it grandmother
said the child
are you not glad
oh yes heidi i am glad because you are happy
but grandmother you seem so anxious
do you still think miss
rottenmeier is coming
oh no it is nothing
give me your hand for i want to be sure that you are still here
i suppose it will be for the best even if i shall not live to see the day
oh but then i would not care about this coming said the child
the grandmother had hardly slept all night for thinking of claras coming
would they take heidi away from her now that she was well and strong
but for the sake of the child she resolved to be brave
heidi she said please read me the song that begins with god will see to it
heidi immediately did as she was told she knew nearly all the grandmothers favorite hymns by now and always found them quickly
that does me good child the old woman said
already the expression of her face seemed happier and less troubled
please read it a few times over child she entreated
thus evening came and when heidi wandered homewards one twinkling star after another appeared in the sky
heidi stood still every few minutes looking up to the firmament in wonder
when she arrived home her grandfather also was looking up to the stars murmuring to himself what a wonderful month
one day clearer than the other
the herbs will be fine and strong this year
the blossom month had passed and june with the long long days had come
quantities of flowers were blooming everywhere filling the air with perfume
the month was nearing its end when one morning heidi came running out of the hut where she had already completed her duties
suddenly she screamed so loud that the grandfather hurriedly came out to see what had happened
grandfather
a strange procession was winding up the alm
first marched two men carrying an open sedan chair with a young girl in it wrapped up in many shawls
then came a stately lady on horseback who talking with a young guide beside her looked eagerly right and left
then an empty rollingchair carried by a young fellow was followed by a porter who had so many covers shawls and furs piled up on his basket that they towered high above his head
they are coming
they are coming
cried heidi in her joy and soon the party had arrived at the top
great was the happiness of the children at seeing each other again
when grandmama had descended from her horse she tenderly greeted heidi first and then turned to the uncle who had approached the group
the two met like two old friends they had heard so much about each other
after the first words were exchanged the grandmother exclaimed my dear uncle what a wonderful residence you have
who would have ever thought it
kings could envy you here
oh how well my heidi is looking just like a little rose
she continued drawing the child closely to her side and patting her cheeks
what glory everywhere
clara what do you say to it all
clara looking about her rapturously cried oh how wonderful how glorious
i have never dreamt it could be as beautiful as that
oh grandmama i wish i could stay here
the uncle had busied himself in the meantime with getting claras rollingchair for her
then going up to the girl he gently lifted her into her seat
putting some covers over her knees he tucked her feet in warmly
it seemed as if the grandfather had done nothing else all his life than nurse lame people
my dear uncle said the grandmama surprised please tell me where you learned that for i shall send all the nurses i know here immediately
the uncle smiled faintly while he replied it comes more from care than study
his face became sad
before his eyes had risen bygone times
for that was the way he used to care for his poor wounded captain whom he had found in sicily after a violent battle
he alone had been allowed to nurse him till his death and now he would take just as good care of poor lame clara
when clara had looked a long time at the cloudless sky above and all the rocky crags she said longingly i wish i could walk round the hut to the firtrees
if i only could see all the things you told me so much about
heidi pushed with all her might and behold
the chair rolled easily over the dry grass
when they had come into the little grove clara could not see her fill of those splendid trees that must have stood there so many many years
although the people had changed and vanished they had remained the same ever looking down into the valley
when they passed the empty goatshed clara said pitifully oh grandmama if i could only wait up here for schwnli and brli
i am afraid i shant see peter and his goats if we have to go away so soon again
dear child enjoy now what you can said the grandmama who had followed
oh what wonderful flowers
exclaimed clara again whole bushes of exquisite red blossoms
oh if i could only pick some of those bluebells
heidi immediately gathering a large bunch put them in claras lap
clara this is really nothing in comparison with the many flowers in the pasture
you must come up once and see them
there are so many that the ground seems golden with them
if you ever sit down among them you will feel as if you could never get up any more it is so beautiful
oh grandmama do you think i can ever go up there
clara asked with a wild longing in her eyes
if i could only walk with you heidi and climb round everywhere
ill push you
heidi said for comfort
to show how easy it was she pushed the chair at such a rate that it would have tumbled down the mountain if the grandfather had not stopped it at the last moment
it was time for dinner now
the table was spread near the bench and soon everybody sat down
the grandmother was so overcome by the view and the delicious wind that fanned her cheek that she remarked what a wondrous place this is
i have never seen its like
but what do i see
she continued
i think you are actually eating your second piece of cheese clara
oh grandmama it tastes better than all the things we get in ragatz replied the child eagerly eating the savory dish
dont stop our mountain wind helps along where the cooking is faulty
contentedly said the old man
during the meal the uncle and the grandmama had soon got into a lively conversation
they seemed to agree on many things and understood each other like old friends
a little later the grandmama looked over to the west
we must soon start clara for the sun is already low our guides will be here shortly
claras face had become sad and she entreated oh please let us stay here another hour or so
we havent even seen the hut yet
i wish the day were twice as long
the grandmama assented to claras wish to go inside
when the rollingchair was found too broad for the door the uncle quietly lifted clara in his strong arms and carried her in
grandmama was eagerly looking about her glad to see everything so neat
then going up the little ladder to the hayloft she discovered heidis bed
is that your bed heidi
what a delicious perfume
it must be a healthy place to sleep she said looking out through the window
the grandfather with clara was coming up too with heidi following
clara was perfectly entranced
what a lovely place to sleep
heidi you can look right up to the sky from your bed
what a good smell
you can hear the firtrees roar here cant you
oh i never saw a more delightful bedroom
the uncle looking at the old lady said now i have an idea that it would give clara new strength to stay up here with us a little while
of course i only mean if you did not object
you have brought so many wraps that we can easily make a soft bed for clara here
my dear lady you can easily leave the care to me
ill undertake it gladly
the children screamed for joy and grandmamas face was beaming
what a fine man you are
she burst out
i was just thinking myself that a stay here would strengthen the child but then i thought of the care and trouble for you
and now you have offered to do it as if it was nothing at all
how can i thank you enough uncle
after shaking hands many times the two prepared claras bed which thanks to the old ladys precautions was soon so soft that the hay could not be felt through at all
the uncle had carried his new patient back to her rollingchair and there they found her sitting with heidi beside her
they were eagerly talking of their plans for the coming weeks
when they were told that
clara might stay for a month or so their faces beamed more than ever
the guide with the horse and the carriers of the chair now appeared but the last two were not needed any more and could be sent away
when the grandmother got ready to leave clara called gaily to her oh grandmama it wont be long for you must often come and see us
while the uncle was leading the horse down the steep incline the grandmama told him that she would go back to ragatz for the drfli was too lonely for her
she also promised to come back from time to time
before the grandfather had returned peter came racing down to the hut with all his goats
seeing heidi they ran up to her in haste and so
clara made the acquaintance of schwnli and brli and all the others
peter however kept away only sending furious looks at the two girls
when they bade him goodnight he only ran away beating the air with his stick
the end of the joyous day had come
the two children were both lying in their beds
clara exclaimed i can see so many glittering stars and
i feel as if we were driving in a high carriage straight into the sky
yes and do you know why the stars twinkle so merrily
no but tell me
because they know that god in heaven looks after us mortals and we never need to fear
see they twinkle and show us how to be merry too
but clara we must not forget to pray to god and ask him to think of us and keep us safe
sitting up in bed they then said their evening prayer
as soon as
heidi lay down she fell asleep
but clara could not sleep quite yet it was too wonderful to see the stars from her bed
in truth she had never seen them before because in frankfurt all the blinds were always down long before the stars came out and at night she had never been outside the house
she could hardly keep her eyes shut and had to open them again and again to watch the twinkling glistening stars till her eyes closed at last and she saw two big glittering stars in her dream
of further events on the alp
the sun was just rising and the almuncle was watching how mountain and dale awoke to the new day and the clouds above grew brighter
next the old man turned to go back into the hut and softly climbed the ladder
clara having just a moment ago opened her eyes looked about her in amazement
bright sunbeams danced on her bed
where was she
but soon she discovered her sleeping friend and heard the grandfathers cheery voice how did you sleep
clara feeling fresh and rested said that she had never slept better in all her life
heidi was soon awake too and lost no time in coming down to join clara who was already sitting in the sun
a cool morning breeze fanned their cheeks and the spicy fragrance from the firtrees filled their lungs with every breath
clara had never experienced such wellbeing in all her life
she had never breathed such pure cool morning air and never felt such warm delicious sunshine on her feet and hands
it surpassed all her expectations
oh heidi i wish i could always stay up here with you
now you can see that everything is as beautiful as i told you heidi replied triumphantly
up on the alp with grandfather is the loveliest spot in all the world
the grandfather was just coming out of the shed with two full bowls of steaming snowwhite milk
handing one to each of the children he said to clara this will do you good little girl
it comes from
schwnli and will give you strength
to your health
just drink it
he said encouragingly for clara had hesitated a little
but when she saw that heidis bowl was nearly empty already she also drank without even stopping
oh how good it was
it tasted like cinnamon and sugar
well take two tomorrow said the grandfather
after their breakfast peter arrived
while the goats were rushing up to heidi bleating loudly the grandfather took the boy aside
just listen and do what i tell you he said
from now on you must let schwnli go wherever she likes
she knows where to get the richest herbs and you must follow her even if she should go higher up than usual
it wont do you any harm to climb a little more and will do all the others good
i want the goats to give me splendid milk remember
what are you looking at so furiously
peter was silent and without more ado started off still angrily looking back now and then
as heidi had followed a little way peter called to her you must come along heidi schwnli has to be followed everywhere
no but i cant heidi called back i wont be able to come as long as clara is with me
grandfather has promised though to let us come up with you once
with those words heidi returned to clara while the goatherd was hurrying onward angrily shaking his fists
the children had promised to write a letter to grandmama every day so they immediately started on their task
heidi brought out her own little threelegged stool her schoolbooks and her papers and with these on claras lap they began to write
clara stopped after nearly every sentence for she had to look around
oh how peaceful it was with the little gnats dancing in the sun and the rustling of the trees
from time to time they could hear the shouting of a shepherd reechoed from many rocks
the morning had passed they knew not how and dinner was ready
they again ate outside for clara had to be in the open air all day if possible
the afternoon was spent in the cool shadow of the firtrees
clara had many things to relate of frankfurt and all the people that
heidi knew
it was not long before peter arrived with his flock but without even answering the girls friendly greeting he disappeared with a grim scowl
while schwnli was being milked in the shed clara said oh heidi i feel as if i could not wait for my milk
isnt it funny
all my life i have only eaten because i had to
everything always tasted to me like codliver oil and i have often wished that i should never have to eat
and now i am so hungry
oh yes i know heidi replied
she had to think of the days in
frankfurt when her food seemed to stick in her throat
when at last the full bowls were brought by the old man clara seizing hers eagerly drank the contents in one draught and even finished before heidi
please may i have a little more
she asked holding out the bowl
nodding much pleased the grandfather soon refilled it
this time he also brought with him a slice of bread and butter for the children
he had gone to maiensass that afternoon to get the butter and his trouble was well rewarded they enjoyed it as if it had been the rarest dish
this evening clara fell asleep the moment she lay down
two or three days passed in this pleasant way
the next brought a surprise
two strong porters came up the alp each carrying on his back a fresh white bed
they also brought a letter from grandmama in which she thanked the children for their faithful writing and told them that the beds were meant for them
when they went to sleep that night they found their new beds in exactly the same position as their former ones had been
claras rapture in her new life grew greater every day and she could not write enough of the grandfathers kindly care and of heidis entertaining stories
she told her grandmama that her first thought in the morning always was thank god i am still in the almhut
grandmama was highly pleased at those reports and put her projected visit off a little while for she had found the ride pretty tiring
the grandfather took excellent care of his little patient and no day passed on which he did not climb around to find the most savory herbs for schwnli
the little goat thrived so that everybody could see it in the way her eyes were flashing
it was the third week of claras stay
every morning after the grandfather had carried her down he said to her would my clara try to stand a little
clara always sighed oh it hurts me so
but though she would cling to him he made her stand a little longer every day
this summer was the finest that had been for years
day after day the sun shone on a cloudless sky and at night it would pour its purple rosy light down on the rocks and snowfields till everything seemed to glow like fire
heidi had told clara over and over again of all the flowers on the pasture of the masses of golden roses and the blueflowers that covered the ground
she had just been telling it again when a longing seized her and jumping up she ran over to her grandfather who was busy carving in the shop
oh grandfather she cried from afar wont you come with us to the pasture tomorrow
oh its so beautiful up there now
all right i will he replied but tell clara that she must do something to please me she must try to stand longer this evening for me
heidi merrily came running with her message
of course clara promised for was it not her greatest wish to go up with heidi to the pasture
when peter returned this evening he heard of the plan for the morrow
but for answer peter only growled nearly hitting poor
thistlefinch in his anger
the children had just resolved to stay awake all night to talk about the coming day when their conversation suddenly ceased and they were both peacefully slumbering
in her dreams clara saw before her a field that was thickly strewn with lightblue flowers while heidi heard the eagle scream to her from above come come come
something unexpected happens
the next day dawned cloudless and fair
the grandfather was still with the children when peter came climbing up his goats kept at a good distance from him to evade the rod which was striking right and left
the truth was that the boy was terribly embittered and angry by the changes that had come
when he passed the hut in the morning
heidi was always busy with the strange child and in the evening it was the same
all summer long heidi had not been up with him a single time it was too much
and today she was coming at last but again in company with this hateful stranger
illustration he watched his fallen enemy tumbling downwards downwards
it was then that peter noticed the rollingchair standing near the hut
after carefully glancing about him he rushed at the hated object and pushed it down the incline
the chair fairly flew away and had soon disappeared
peters conscience smote him now and he raced up the alp not daring to pause till he had reached a blackberry bush
there he could hide when the uncle might appear
looking down he watched his fallen enemy tumbling downwards downwards
sometimes it was thrown high up into the air to crash down again the next moment harder than ever
pieces were falling from it right and left and were blown about
now the stranger would have to travel home and heidi would be his again
but peter had forgotten that a bad deed always brings a punishment
heidi just now came out of the hut
the grandfather with clara followed
heidi at first stood still and then running right and left she returned to the old man
what does this mean
have you rolled the chair away heidi
i am just looking for it everywhere grandfather
you said it was beside the shop door said the child still hunting for the missing object
a strong wind was blowing which at this moment violently closed the shopdoor
grandfather the wind has done it exclaimed heidi eagerly
if it has rolled all the way down to the village it will be too late to go today
it will take us a long time to fetch it
if it has rolled down there we shall never get it any more for it will be smashed to pieces said the old man looking down and measuring the distance from the corner of the hut
i dont see how it happened he remarked
what a shame
now ill never be able to go up to the pasture lamented clara
i am afraid ill have to go home now
what a pity what a pity
you can find a way for her to stay grandfather cant you
well go up to the pasture today as we have planned
then we shall see what further happens
the children were delighted and the grandfather lost no time in getting ready
first he fetched a pile of covers and seating clara on a sunny spot on the dry ground he got their breakfast
i wonder why peter is so late today he said leading his goats out of the shed
then lifting clara up on one strong arm he carried the covers on the other
the goats come with us
that suited heidi and with one arm round schwnli and the other round
brli she wandered up
her little companions were so pleased at having her with them again that they nearly crushed her with affection
what was their astonishment when arriving on top they saw peter already lying on the ground with his peaceful flock about him
what did you mean by going by us like that
ill teach you
called the uncle to him
peter was frightened for he knew the voice
nobody was up yet the boy retorted
have you seen the chair
asked the uncle again
peter growled
the uncle said no more
unfolding the covers he put clara down on the dry grass
then when he had been assured of claras comfort he got ready to go home
the three were to stay there till his return in the evening
when dinner time had come heidi was to prepare the meal and see that clara got schwnlis milk
the sky was a deep blue and the snow on the peaks was glistening
the eagle was floating above the rocky crags
the children felt wonderfully happy
now and then one of the goats would come and lie down near them
tender little snowhopper came oftener than any and would rub her head against their shoulders
they had been sitting quietly for a few hours drinking in the beauty about them when heidi suddenly began to long for the spot where so many flowers grew
in the evening it would be too late to see them for they always shut their little eyes by then
oh clara she said hesitatingly would you be angry if i went away from you a minute and left you alone
i want to see the flowers but wait
jumping away she brought clara some bunches of fragrant herbs and put them in her lap
soon after she returned with little
snowhopper
so now you dont need to be alone said heidi
when clara had assured her that it would give her pleasure to be left alone with the goats heidi started on her walk
clara slowly handed one leaf after another to the little creature it became more and more confiding and cuddling close to the child ate the herbs out of her hand
it was easy to see how happy it was to be away from the boisterous big goats which often annoyed it
clara felt a sensation of contentment such as she had never before experienced
she loved to sit there on the mountainside with the confiding little goat by her
a great desire rose in her heart that hour
she longed to be her own master and be able to help others instead of being helped by them
many other thoughts and ideas rushed through her mind
how would it be to live up here in continual sunshine
the world seemed so joyous and wonderful all of a sudden
premonitions of future undreamtof happiness made her heart beat
suddenly she threw both arms about the little goat and said oh little snowhopper how beautiful it is up here
if i could always stay with you
heidi in the meantime had reached the spot where as she had expected the whole ground was covered with yellow rockroses
near together in patches the bluebells were nodding gently in the breeze
but all the perfume that filled the air came from the modest little brown flowers that hid their heads between the golden flowercups
heidi stood enraptured drawing in the perfumed air
suddenly she turned and ran back to clara shouting to her from far oh you must come clara it is so lovely there
in the evening it wont be so fine any more
dont you think i could carry you
but heidi clara said of course you cant you are much smaller than i am
oh i wish i could walk
heidi meditated a little
peter was still lying on the ground
he had been staring down for hours unable to believe what he saw before him
he had destroyed the chair to get rid of the stranger and there she was again sitting right beside his playmate
heidi now called to him to come down but as reply he only grumbled shant come
but you must come quickly for i want you to help me
urged the child
dont want to sounded the reply
heidi hurried up the mountain now and shouted angrily to the boy peter if you dont come this minute i shall do something that you wont like
those words scared peter for his conscience was not clear
his deed had rejoiced him till this moment when heidi seemed to talk as if she knew it all
what if the grandfather should hear about it
trembling with fear peter obeyed
i shall only come if you promise not to do what you said insisted the boy
no no i wont
dont be afraid said heidi compassionately just come along it isnt so hard
peter on approaching clara was told to help raise the lame child from the ground on one side while heidi helped on the other
this went easily enough but difficulties soon followed
clara was not able to stand alone and how could they get any further
you must take me round the neck said heidi who had seen what poor guides they made
the boy who had never offered his arm to anybody in his life had to be shown how first before further efforts could be made
but it was too hard
clara tried to set her feet forward but got discouraged
press your feet on the ground more and i am sure it will hurt you less suggested heidi
do you think so
said clara timidly
but obeying she ventured a firmer step and soon another uttering a little cry as she went
oh it really has hurt me less she said joyfully
try it again heidi urged her
clara did and took another step and then another and another still
suddenly she cried aloud oh heidi
i can do it
oh i really can
i can take steps one after another
heidi rapturously exclaimed oh clara can you really
can you walk
oh can you take steps now
oh if only grandfather would come
now you can walk clara now you can walk she kept on saying joyfully
clara held on tight to the children but with every new step she became more firm
now you can come up here every day cried heidi
now we can walk wherever we want to and you dont have to be pushed in a chair any more
now youll be able to walk all your life
oh what joy
claras greatest wish to be able to be well like other people had been fulfilled at last
it was not very far to the flowering field
soon they reached it and sat down among the wealth of bloom
it was the first time that clara had ever rested on the dry warm earth
all about them the flowers nodded and exhaled their perfume
it was a scene of exquisite beauty
the two children could hardly grasp this happiness that had come to them
it filled their hearts brimming full and made them silent
peter also lay motionless for he had gone to sleep
thus the hours flew and the day was long past noon
suddenly all the goats arrived for they had been seeking the children
they did not like to graze in the flowers and were glad when peter awoke with their loud bleating
the poor boy was mightily bewildered for he had dreamt that the rollingchair with the red cushions stood again before his eyes
on awaking he had still seen the golden nails but soon he discovered that they were nothing but flowers
remembering his deed he obeyed heidis instructions willingly
when they came back to their former place heidi lost no time in setting out the dinner
the bag was very full today and heidi hurried to fulfill her promise to peter who with bad conscience had understood her threat differently
she made three heaps of the good things and when clara and she were through there was still a lot left for the boy
it was too bad that all this treat did not give him the usual satisfaction for something seemed to stick in his throat
soon after their belated dinner the grandfather was seen climbing up the alp
heidi ran to meet him confusedly telling him of the great event
the old mans face shone at this news
going over to clara he said so you have risked it
now we have won
then picking her up he put one arm around her waist and the other one he stretched out as support and with his help she marched more firmly than ever
heidi jumped and bounded gaily by their side
in all this excitement the grandfather did not lose his judgment and before long lifted clara on his arm to carry her home
he knew that too much exertion would be dangerous and rest was needed for the tired girl
peter arriving in the village late that day saw a large disputing crowd
they were all standing about an interesting object and everybody pushed and fought for a chance to get nearest
it was no other than the chair
i saw it when they carried it up peter heard the baker say
i bet it was worth at least five hundred francs
i should just like to know how it has happened
the wind might have blown it down remarked barbara who was staring openmouthed at the beautiful velvet cushions
the uncle said so himself
it is a good thing if nobody else has done it continued the baker
when the gentleman from frankfurt hears what has happened hell surely find out all about it and i should pity the culprit
i havent been up on the alm for so long else they might suspect me as they would anybody who happened to be up there at the time
many more opinions were uttered but peter had heard enough
he quietly slipped away and went home
what if they should find out he had done it
a policeman might arrive any time now and they might take him away to prison
peters hair stood up on end at this alarming thought
he was so troubled when he came home that he did not answer any questions and even refused his dish of potatoes
hurriedly creeping into bed he groaned
i am sure peter has eaten sorrel again and that makes him groan so said his mother
you must give him a little more bread in the morning brigida
take a piece of mine said the compassionate grandmother
what do you mean heidi
asked clara
you see when i was in frankfurt i prayed and prayed to come home again and when i couldnt i thought he had forgotten me
but if i had gone away so soon you would never have come here and would never have got well
clara becoming thoughtful said but heidi then we could not pray for anything any more because we would feel that he always knows of something better
but clara we must pray to god every day to show we dont forget that all gifts come from him
grandmama has told me that god forgets us if we forget him
but if some wish remains unfulfilled we must show our confidence in him for he knows best
how did you ever think of that
asked clara
grandmama told me but i know that it is so
we must thank god today that he has made you able to walk clara
i am glad that you have reminded me heidi for i have nearly forgotten it in my excitement
the children both prayed and sent their thanks up to heaven for the restoration of the invalid
next morning a letter was written to grandmama inviting her to come up to the alp within a weeks time for the children had planned to take her by surprise
clara hoped then to be able to walk alone with
heidi for her guide
the following days were happier still for clara
every morning she awoke with her heart singing over and over again now i am well
i can walk like other people
she progressed and took longer walks every day
her appetite grew amazingly and the grandfather had to make larger slices of the bread and butter that to his delight disappeared so rapidly
he had to fill bowl after bowl of the foaming milk for the hungry children
in that way they reached the end of the week that was to bring the grandmama
illustration
parting to meet again
a day before her visit the grandmama had sent a letter to announce her coming
peter brought it up with him next morning
the grandfather was already before the hut with the children and his merry goats
his face looked proud as he contemplated the rosy faces of the girls and the shining hair of his two goats
peter approaching neared the uncle slowly
as soon as he had delivered the letter he sprang back shyly looking about him as if he was afraid
then with a leap he started off
i should like to know why peter behaves like the big turk when he is afraid of the rod said heidi watching his strange behavior
maybe peter fears a rod that he deserves said the old man
all the way peter was tormented with fear
he could not help thinking of the policeman who was coming from frankfurt to fetch him to prison
it was a busy morning for heidi who put the hut in order for the expected visitor
the time went by quickly and soon everything was ready to welcome the good grandmama
the grandfather also returned from a walk on which he had gathered a glorious bunch of deepblue gentians
the children who were sitting on the bench exclaimed for joy when they saw the glowing flowers
heidi getting up from time to time to spy down the path suddenly discovered grandmama sitting on a white horse and accompanied by two men
one of them carried plenty of wraps for without those the lady did not dare to pay such a visit
the party came nearer and nearer and soon reached the top
what do i see
clara what is this
why are you not sitting in your chair
how is this possible
cried the grandmama in alarm dismounting hastily
before she had quite reached the children she threw her arms up in great excitement clara is that really you
you have red round cheeks my child
i hardly know you any more
grandmama was going to rush at her grandchild when heidi slipped from the bench and clara taking her arm they quietly took a little walk
the grandmama was rooted to the spot from fear
what was this
upright and firm clara walked beside her friend
when they came back their rosy faces beamed
rushing toward the children the grandmother hugged them over and over again
looking over to the bench she beheld the uncle who sat there smiling
taking claras arm in hers she walked over to him continually venting her delight
when she reached the old man she took both his hands in hers and said my dear dear uncle
what have we to thank you for
this is your work your care and nursing but our lords sunshine and mountain air interrupted the uncle smiling
then clara called yes and also schwnlis good delicious milk
grandmama you ought to see how much goatmilk i can drink now oh it is so good
indeed i can see that from your cheeks said the grandmama smiling
no i hardly recognize you any more
you have become broad and round
i never dreamt that you could get so stout and tall
oh clara is it really true
i cannot look at you enough
but now i must telegraph your father to come
i shant tell him anything about you for it will be the greatest joy of all his life
my dear uncle how are we going to manage it
have you sent the men away
i have but i can easily send the goatherd
so they decided that peter should take the message
the uncle immediately whistled so loud that it resounded from all sides
peter arrived white with fear for he thought his doom had come
but he only received a paper that was to be carried to the postoffice of the village
relieved for the moment peter set out
now all the happy friends sat down round the table and grandmama was told how the miracle had happened
often the talk was interrupted by exclamations of surprise from grandmama who still believed it was all a dream
how could this be her pale weak little clara
the children were in a constant state of joy to see how their surprise had worked
meanwhile mr
sesemann having finished his business in paris was also preparing a surprise
without writing his mother he traveled to
ragatz on a sunny summer morning
he had arrived on this very day some hours after his mothers departure and now taking a carriage he drove to mayenfeld
the long ascent to the alp from there seemed very weary and far to the traveller
when would he reach the goatherds hut
there were many little roads branching off in several directions and sometimes
sesemann doubted if he had taken the right path
but not a soul was near and no sound could be heard except the rustling of the wind and the hum of little insects
a merry little bird was singing on a larchtree but nothing more
standing still and cooling his brow he saw a boy running down the hill at topmost speed
sesemann called to him but with no success for the boy kept at a shy distance
now my boy cant you tell me if i am on the right path to the hut where heidi lives and the people from frankfurt are staying
a dull sound of terror was the only reply
peter shot off and rushed head over heels down the mountainside turning wild somersaults on his perilous way
his course resembled the course his enemy had taken some days ago
illustration peter shot off and rushed down the mountainside
turning wild somersaults on his perilous way what a funny bashful mountaineer
sesemann remarked to himself thinking that the appearance of a stranger had upset this simple son of the alps
after watching the downward course of the boy a little while he soon proceeded on his way
in spite of the greatest effort peter could not stop himself and kept rolling on
but his fright and terror were still more terrible than his bumps and blows
this stranger was the policeman that was a certain fact
at last being thrown against a bush he clutched it wildly
good heres another one
a voice near peter said
i wonder who is going to be pushed down tomorrow looking like a halfopen potatobag
the village baker was making fun of him
for a little rest after his weary work he had quietly watched the boy
peter regained his feet and slunk away
how did the baker know the chair had been pushed
he longed to go home to bed and hide for there alone he felt safe
but he had to go up to the goats and the uncle had clearly told him to come back as quickly as he could
groaning he limped away up to the alp
how could he run now with his fear and all his poor sore limbs
sesemann had reached the hut soon after meeting peter and felt reassured
climbing further with renewed courage he at last saw his goal before him but not without long and weary exertion
he saw the
almhut above him and the swaying firtrees
sesemann eagerly hurried to encounter his beloved child
they had seen him long ago from the hut and a treat was prepared for him that he never suspected
as he made the last steps he saw two forms coming towards him
a tall girl with light hair and rosy face was leaning on heidi whose dark eyes sparkled with keen delight
sesemann stopped short staring at this vision
suddenly big tears rushed from his eyes for this shape before him recalled sweet memories
claras mother had looked exactly like this fair maiden
sesemann at this moment did not know if he was awake or dreaming
papa dont you know me any more
clara called with beaming eyes
have i changed so much
sesemann rushed up to her folding her in his arms
yes you have changed
how is it possible
is it really true
is it really you clara
asked the overjoyed father embracing her again and again and then gazing at her as she stood tall and firm by his side
his mother joined them now for she wanted to see the happiness of her son
what do you say to this my son
isnt our surprise finer than yours
she greeted him
but come over to our benefactor nowi mean the uncle
yes indeed i also must greet our little heidi said the gentleman shaking heidis hand
always fresh and happy on the mountain
i guess i dont need to ask for no alpine rose can look more blooming
ah child what joy this is to me
with beaming eyes the child looked at the kind gentleman who had always been so good to her
her heart throbbed in sympathy with his joy
while the two men who had at last approached each other were conversing grandmama walked over to the grove
there under the firtrees another surprise awaited her
a beautiful bunch of wondrously blue gentians stood as if they had grown there
how exquisite how wonderful
what a sight
she exclaimed clapping her hands
heidi come here
have you brought me those
oh they are beautiful
the children had joined her heidi assuring her that it was another persons deed
oh grandmama up on the pasture it looks just like that clara remarked
just guess who brought you the flowers
at that moment a rustle was heard and they saw peter who was trying to sneak up behind the trees to avoid the hut
immediately the old lady called to him for she thought that peter himself had picked the flowers for her
he must be creeping away out of sheer modesty the kind lady thought
to give him his reward she called come here my boy
dont be afraid
petrified with fear peter stood still
what had gone before had robbed him of his courage
he thought now that all was over with him
with his hair standing up on end and his pale face distorted by anguish he approached
come straight to me boy the old lady encouraged him
now tell me boy if you have done that
in his anxiety peter did not see the grandmamas finger that pointed to the flowers
he only saw the uncle standing near the hut looking at him penetratingly and beside him the policeman the greatest horror for him in the world
trembling in every limb peter answered yes
well but what are you so frightened about
becausebecause it is broken and can never be mended again peter said his knees tottering under him
the grandmama now walked over to the hut my dear uncle she asked kindly is this poor lad out of his mind
not at all was the reply only the boy was the wind which blew away the wheelchair
he is expecting the punishment he well deserves
grandmama was very much surprised for she vowed that peter looked far from wicked
why should he have destroyed the chair
the uncle told her that he had noticed many signs of anger in the boy since claras advent on the alp
he assured her that he had suspected the boy from the beginning
my dear uncle the old lady said with animation we must not punish him further
we must be just
it was very hard on him when clara robbed him of heidi who is and was his greatest treasure
when he had to sit alone day after day it roused him to a passion which drove him to this wicked deed
it was rather foolish but we all get so when we get angry
the lady walked over to the boy again who was still quivering with fear
sitting down on the bench she began come peter ill tell you something
stop trembling and listen
you pushed the chair down to destroy it
you knew very well that it was wicked and deserved punishment
you tried very hard to conceal it did you not
but if somebody thinks that nobody knows about a wicked deed he is wrong god always knows it
as soon as he finds that a man is trying to conceal an evil he has done he wakens a little watchman in his heart who keeps on pricking the person with a thorn till all his rest is gone
he keeps on calling to the evildoer now youll be found out
now your punishment is near
his joy has flown for fear and terror take its place
have you not just had such an experience
peter nodded all contrite
he certainly had experienced this
you have made a mistake the grandmama continued by thinking that you would hurt clara by destroying her chair
it has so happened that what you have done has been the greatest good for her
she would probably never have tried to walk if her chair had been there
if she should stay here she might even go up to the pasture every single day
do you see peter
god can turn a misdeed to the good of the injured person and bring trouble on the offender
have you understood me peter
remember the little watchman when you long to do a wicked deed again
will you do that
yes i shall peter replied still fearing the policeman who had not left yet
so now that matter is all settled said the old lady in conclusion
now tell me if you have a wish my boy for i am going to give you something by which to remember your friends from frankfurt
what is it
what would you like to have
peter lifting his head stared at the grandmama with round astonished eyes
he was confused by this sudden change of prospect
being again urged to utter a wish he saw at last that he was saved from the power of the terrible man
he felt as if the most crushing load had fallen off him
he knew now that it was better to confess at once when something had gone wrong so he said i have also lost the paper
reflecting a while the grandmama understood and said that is right
always confess what is wrong then it can be settled
and now what would you like to have
so peter could choose everything in the world he wished
his brain got dizzy
he saw before him all the wonderful things in the fair in
he had often stood there for hours looking at the pretty red whistles and the little knives unfortunately peter had never possessed more than half what those objects cost
he stood thinking not able to decide when a bright thought struck him
ten pennies said peter with decision
that certainly is not too much the old lady said with a smile taking out of her pocket a big round thaler on top of which she laid twenty pennies
now ill explain this to you
here you have as many times ten pennies as there are weeks in the year
youll be able to spend one every sunday through the year
all my life
peter asked quite innocently
the grandmama began to laugh so heartily at this that the two men came over to join her
laughingly she said you shall have it my boy i will put it in my will and then you will do the same my son
peter the goatherd shall have a tenpenny piece weekly as long as he lives
sesemann nodded
peter looking at his gift said solemnly god be thanked
jumping and bounding he ran away
his heart was so light that he felt he could fly
a little later the whole party sat round the table holding a merry feast
after dinner clara who was lively as never before said to her father oh papa if you only knew all the things grandfather did for me
it would take many days to tell you i shall never forget them all my life
oh if we could please him only half as much as what he did for me
it is my greatest wish too dear child said her father i have been trying to think of something all the time
we have to show our gratitude in some way
accordingly mr
sesemann walked over to the old man and began my dear friend may i say one word to you
i am sure you believe me when
i tell you that i have not known any real joy for years
what was my wealth to me when i could not cure my child and make her happy
with the help of the lord you have made her well
you have given her a new life
please tell me how to show my gratitude to you
i know i shall never be able to repay you but what is in my power i shall do
have you any request to make
please let me know
the uncle had listened quietly and had looked at the happy father
sesemann you can be sure that i also am repaid by the great joy
i experience at the recovery of clara said the uncle firmly
i thank you for your kind offer mr
as long as i live i have enough for me and the child
but i have one wish
if this could be fulfilled my life would be free of care
speak my dear friend urged claras father
i am old continued the uncle and shall not live many years
i die i cannot leave heidi anything
the child has no relations except one who even might try to take advantage of her if she could
if you would give me the assurance mr
sesemann that heidi will never be obliged to go into the world and earn her bread you would amply repay me for what i was able to do for you and clara
my dear friend there is no question of that began mr
sesemann the child belongs to us
i promise at once that we shall look after her so that there will not be any need of her ever earning her bread
we all know that she is not fashioned for a life among strangers
nevertheless she has made some true friends and one of them will be here very shortly
classen is just now completing his last business in frankfurt
he intends to take your advice and live here
he has never felt so happy as with you and heidi
the child will have two protectors near her and i hope with gods will that they may be spared a long long time
and may it be gods will
added the grandmama who with heidi had joined them shaking the uncle tenderly by the hand
putting her arms around the child she said heidi i want to know if you also have a wish
yes indeed i have said heidi pleased
tell me what it is child
i should like to have my bed from frankfurt with the three high pillows and the thick warm cover
then grandmother will be able to keep warm and wont have to wear her shawl in bed
oh ill be so happy when she wont have to lie with her head lower than her heels hardly able to breathe
heidi had said all this in one breath she was so eager
oh dear i had nearly forgotten what i meant to do
i am so glad you have reminded me heidi
if god sends us happiness we must think of those who have many privations
i shall telegraph immediately for the bed and if miss rottenmeier sends it off at once it can be here in two days
i hope the poor blind grandmother will sleep better when it comes
heidi in her happiness could hardly wait to bring the old woman the good news
soon it was resolved that everybody should visit the grandmother who had been left alone so long
before starting however mr
sesemann revealed his plans
he proposed to travel through switzerland with his mother and clara
he would spend the night in the village so as to fetch clara from the alm next morning for the journey
from there they would go first to ragatz and then further
the telegram was to be mailed that night
claras feelings were divided for she was sorry to leave the alp but the prospect of the trip delighted her
when everything was settled they all went down the uncle carrying
clara who could not have risked the lengthy walk
all the way down
heidi told the old lady of her friends in the hut the cold they had to bear in winter and the little food they had
brigida was just hanging up peters shirt to dry when the whole company arrived
rushing into the house she called to her mother now they are all going away
uncle is going too carrying the lame child
oh must it really be
sighed the grandmother
have you seen whether they took heidi away
oh if she only could give me her hand once more
oh i long to hear her voice once more
the same moment the door was flung open and heidi held her tight
grandmother just think
my bed with the three pillows and the thick cover is coming from frankfurt
grandmama has said that it will be here in two days
heidi thought that grandmother would be beside herself with joy but the old woman smiling sadly said oh what a good lady she must be
i know i ought to be glad she is taking you with her heidi but i dont think i shall survive it long
but nobody has said so the grandmama who had overheard those words said kindly
pressing the old womans hand she continued it is out of the question
heidi will stay with you and make you happy
to see heidi again we will come up every year to the alm for we have many reasons to thank the lord there
immediately the face of the grandmother lighted up and she cried tears of joy
oh what wonderful things god is doing for me
said the grandmother deeply touched
how good people are to trouble themselves about such a poor old woman as i
nothing in this world strengthens the belief in a good father in heaven more than this mercy and kindness shown to a poor useless little woman like me
my dear grandmother said mrs
sesemann before god in heaven we are all equally miserable and poor woe to us if he should forget us
but now we must say goodbye next year we shall come to see you just as soon as we come up the alp
we shall never forget you
with that mrs
sesemann shook her hand
it was some time before she was allowed to leave however because the grandmother thanked her over and over again and invoked all heavens blessings on her and her house
sesemann and his mother went on down while clara was carried up to spend her last night in the hut
next morning clara shed hot tears at parting from the beloved place where such gladness had been hers
heidi consoled her with plans for the coming summer that was to be even more happy than this one had been
sesemann then arrived and a few last parting words were exchanged
clara half crying suddenly said please give my love to peter and the goats heidi
please greet schwnli especially from me for she has helped a great deal in making me well
what could i give her
you can send her salt clara
you know how fond she is of that advised little heidi
oh i will surely do that clara assented
ill send her a hundred pounds of salt as a remembrance from me
it was time to go now and clara was able to ride proudly beside her father
standing on the edge of the slope heidi waved her hand her eyes following clara till she had disappeared
the bed has arrived
grandmother sleeps so well every night now that before long she will be stronger than ever
grandmama has not forgotten the cold winter on the alp and has sent a great many warm covers and shawls to the goatherds hut
grandmother can wrap herself up now and will not have to sit shivering in a corner
in the village a large building is in progress
the doctor has arrived and is living at present in his old quarters
he has taken the uncles advice and has bought the old ruins that sheltered heidi and her grandfather the winter before
he is rebuilding for himself the portion with the fine apartment already mentioned
the other side is being prepared for heidi and her grandfather
the doctor knows that his friend is an independent man and likes to have his own dwelling
brli and schwnli of course are not forgotten they will spend the winter in a good solid stable that is being built for them
the doctor and the almuncle become better friends every day
when they overlook the progress of the building they generally come to speak of heidi
they both look forward to the time when they will be able to move into the house with their merry charge
they have agreed to share together the pleasure and responsibility that heidi brings them
the uncles heart is filled with gratitude too deep for any words when the doctor tells him that he will make ample provision for the child
now her grandfathers heart is free of care for if he is called away another father will take care of heidi and love her in his stead
at the moment when our story closes heidi and peter are sitting in grandmothers hut
the little girl has so many interesting things to relate and peter is trying so hard not to miss anything that in their eagerness they are not aware that they are near the happy grandmothers chair
all summer long they have hardly met and very many wonderful things have happened
they are all glad at being together again and it is hard to tell who is the happiest of the group
i think brigidas face is more radiant than any for heidi has just told her the story of the perpetual tenpenny piece
finally the grandmother says heidi please read me a song of thanksgiving and praise
i feel that i must praise and thank the lord for the blessings
he has brought to us all
