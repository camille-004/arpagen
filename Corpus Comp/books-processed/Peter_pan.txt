when wendy grew up
peter breaks through
all children except one grow up
they soon know that they will grow up and the way wendy knew was this
one day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother
i suppose she must have looked rather delightful for mrs
darling put her hand to her heart and cried oh why cant you remain like this for ever
this was all that passed between them on the subject but henceforth wendy knew that she must grow up
you always know after you are two
two is the beginning of the end
of course they lived at and until wendy came her mother was the chief one
she was a lovely lady with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth
the way mr
darling won her was this the many gentlemen who had been boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her and they all ran to her house to propose to her except mr
darling who took a cab and nipped in first and so he got her
he got all of her except the innermost box and the kiss
he never knew about the box and in time he gave up trying for the kiss
wendy thought napoleon could have got it but i can picture him trying and then going off in a passion slamming the door
darling used to boast to wendy that her mother not only loved him but respected him
he was one of those deep ones who know about stocks and shares
of course no one really knows but he quite seemed to know and he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any woman respect him
darling was married in white and at first she kept the books perfectly almost gleefully as if it were a game not so much as a
brussels sprout was missing but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped out and instead of them there were pictures of babies without faces
she drew them when she should have been totting up
they were mrs
darlings guesses
wendy came first then john then michael
for a week or two after wendy came it was doubtful whether they would be able to keep her as she was another mouth to feed
darling was frightfully proud of her but he was very honourable and he sat on the edge of mrs
darlings bed holding her hand and calculating expenses while she looked at him imploringly
she wanted to risk it come what might but that was not his way his way was with a pencil and a piece of paper and if she confused him with suggestions he had to begin at the beginning again
now dont interrupt he would beg of her
eight nine seven dot and carry sevendont speak my ownand the pound you lent to that man who came to the doorquiet childdot and carry childthere youve done it
did i say nine nine seven
i said nine nine seven the question is can we try it for a year on nine nine seven
of course we can george she cried
but she was prejudiced in
wendys favour and he was really the grander character of the two
remember mumps he warned her almost threateningly and off he went again
darling loved to have everything just so and mr
darling had a passion for being exactly like his neighbours so of course they had a nurse
as they were poor owing to the amount of milk the children drank this nurse was a prim newfoundland dog called nana who had belonged to no one in particular until the darlings engaged her
she proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse
how thorough she was at bathtime and up at any moment of the night if one of her charges made the slightest cry
of course her kennel was in the nursery
she had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience with and when it needs stocking around your throat
she believed to her last day in oldfashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf and made sounds of contempt over all this newfangled talk about germs and so on
it was a lesson in propriety to see her escorting the children to school walking sedately by their side when they were well behaved and butting them back into line if they strayed
on johns footer days she never once forgot his sweater and she usually carried an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain
there is a room in the basement of miss fulsoms school where the nurses wait
they sat on forms while nana lay on the floor but that was the only difference
they affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to themselves and she despised their light talk
she resented visits to the nursery from mrs
darlings friends but if they did come she first whipped off michaels pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding and smoothed out wendy and made a dash at johns hair
no nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly and mr
darling knew it yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked
he had his position in the city to consider
nana also troubled him in another way
he had sometimes a feeling that she did not admire him
i know she admires you tremendously george
darling would assure him and then she would sign to the children to be specially nice to father
lovely dances followed in which the only other servant liza was sometimes allowed to join
such a midget she looked in her long skirt and maids cap though she had sworn when engaged that she would never see ten again
the gaiety of those romps
and gayest of all was mrs
darling who would pirouette so wildly that all you could see of her was the kiss and then if you had dashed at her you might have got it
there never was a simpler happier family until the coming of peter pan
darling first heard of peter when she was tidying up her childrens minds
if you could keep awake but of course you cant you would see your own mother doing this and you would find it very interesting to watch her
it is quite like tidying up drawers
i dont know whether you have ever seen a map of a persons mind
of course the neverlands vary a good deal
johns for instance had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which john was shooting while
michael who was very small had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it
john lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands michael in a wigwam wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together
on these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles
we too have been there we can still hear the sound of the surf though we shall land no more
of all delectable islands the neverland is the snuggest and most compact not large and sprawly you know with tedious distances between one adventure and another but nicely crammed
when you play at it by day with the chairs and tablecloth it is not in the least alarming but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real
that is why there are nightlights
occasionally in her travels through her childrens minds mrs
darling found things she could not understand and of these quite the most perplexing was the word peter
she knew of no peter and yet he was here and there in john and michaels minds while wendys began to be scrawled all over with him
the name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words and as mrs
darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance
yes he is rather cocky wendy admitted with regret
her mother had been questioning her
but who is he my pet
he is peter pan you know mother
at first mrs
darling did not know but after thinking back into her childhood she just remembered a peter pan who was said to live with the fairies
there were odd stories about him as that when children died he went part of the way with them so that they should not be frightened
she had believed in him at the time but now that she was married and full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such person
besides she said to wendy he would be grown up by this time
oh no he isnt grown up wendy assured her confidently and he is just my size
she meant that he was her size in both mind and body she didnt know how she knew she just knew it
darling consulted mr
darling but he smiled poohpooh
mark my words he said it is some nonsense nana has been putting into their heads just the sort of idea a dog would have
leave it alone and it will blow over
but it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave mrs
darling quite a shock
children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them
for instance they may remember to mention a week after the event happened that when they were in the wood they had met their dead father and had a game with him
it was in this casual way that wendy one morning made a disquieting revelation
some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor which certainly were not there when the children went to bed and mrs
darling was puzzling over them when
wendy said with a tolerant smile i do believe it is that peter again
whatever do you mean wendy
it is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet wendy said sighing
she was a tidy child
she explained in quite a matteroffact way that she thought peter sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her bed and played on his pipes to her
unfortunately she never woke so she didnt know how she knew she just knew
what nonsense you talk precious
no one can get into the house without knocking
i think he comes in by the window she said
my love it is three floors up
were not the leaves at the foot of the window mother
it was quite true the leaves had been found very near the window
darling did not know what to think for it all seemed so natural to wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming
my child the mother cried why did you not tell me of this before
i forgot said wendy lightly
she was in a hurry to get her breakfast
oh surely she must have been dreaming
but on the other hand there were the leaves
darling examined them very carefully they were skeleton leaves but she was sure they did not come from any tree that grew in england
she crawled about the floor peering at it with a candle for marks of a strange foot
she rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls
she let down a tape from the window to the pavement and it was a sheer drop of thirty feet without so much as a spout to climb up by
certainly wendy had been dreaming
but wendy had not been dreaming as the very next night showed the night on which the extraordinary adventures of these children may be said to have begun
on the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed
it happened to be nanas evening off and mrs
darling had bathed them and sung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away into the land of sleep
all were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew
it was something for michael who on his birthday was getting into shirts
the fire was warm however and the nursery dimly lit by three nightlights and presently the sewing lay on mrs
darlings lap
then her head nodded oh so gracefully
she was asleep
look at the four of them wendy and michael over there john here and mrs
darling by the fire
there should have been a fourth nightlight
while she slept she had a dream
she dreamt that the neverland had come too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it
he did not alarm her for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many women who have no children
perhaps he is to be found in the faces of some mothers also
but in her dream he had rent the film that obscures the neverland and she saw wendy and john and michael peeping through the gap
the dream by itself would have been a trifle but while she was dreaming the window of the nursery blew open and a boy did drop on the floor
he was accompanied by a strange light no bigger than your fist which darted about the room like a living thing and i think it must have been this light that wakened mrs
she started up with a cry and saw the boy and somehow she knew at once that he was peter pan
if you or i or wendy had been there we should have seen that he was very like mrs
darlings kiss
he was a lovely boy clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees but the most entrancing thing about him was that he had all his first teeth
when he saw she was a grownup he gnashed the little pearls at her
chapter ii
the shadow
darling screamed and as if in answer to a bell the door opened and nana entered returned from her evening out
she growled and sprang at the boy who leapt lightly through the window
she returned to the nursery and found nana with something in her mouth which proved to be the boys shadow
as he leapt at the window
nana had closed it quickly too late to catch him but his shadow had not had time to get out slam went the window and snapped it off
you may be sure mrs
darling examined the shadow carefully but it was quite the ordinary kind
nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow
she hung it out at the window meaning he is sure to come back for it let us put it where he can get it easily without disturbing the children
but unfortunately mrs
darling could not leave it hanging out at the window it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the house
she thought of showing it to mr
she decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer until a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband
the opportunity came a week later on that nevertobeforgotten
of course it was a friday
i ought to have been specially careful on a friday she used to say afterwards to her husband while perhaps nana was on the other side of her holding her hand
darling always said i am responsible for it all
george darling did it
mea culpa mea culpa
he had had a classical education
they sat thus night after night recalling that fatal friday till every detail of it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other side like the faces on a bad coinage
if only i had not accepted that invitation to dine at mrs
darling said
if only i had not poured my medicine into nanas bowl said mr
if only i had pretended to like the medicine was what nanas wet eyes said
my liking for parties george
my fatal gift of humour dearest
my touchiness about trifles dear master and mistress
then one or more of them would break down altogether nana at the thought its true its true they ought not to have had a dog for a nurse
many a time it was mr
darling who put the handkerchief to
nanas eyes
that fiend
darling would cry and nanas bark was the echo of it but mrs
darling never upbraided peter there was something in the righthand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call peter names
they would sit there in the empty nursery recalling fondly every smallest detail of that dreadful evening
it had begun so uneventfully so precisely like a hundred other evenings with nana putting on the water for michaels bath and carrying him to it on her back
i wont go to bed he had shouted like one who still believed that he had the last word on the subject i wont i wont
nana it isnt six oclock yet
oh dear oh dear i shant love you any more nana
i tell you i wont be bathed i wont i wont
darling had come in wearing her white eveninggown
she had dressed early because wendy so loved to see her in her eveninggown with the necklace george had given her
she was wearing wendys bracelet on her arm she had asked for the loan of it
wendy loved to lend her bracelet to her mother
she had found her two older children playing at being herself and father on the occasion of wendys birth and john was saying i am happy to inform you mrs
darling that you are now a mother in just such a tone as mr
darling himself may have used on the real occasion
wendy had danced with joy just as the real mrs
darling must have done
then john was born with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the birth of a male and michael came from his bath to ask to be born also but john said brutally that they did not want any more
michael had nearly cried
nobody wants me he said and of course the lady in the eveningdress could not stand that
i do she said i so want a third child
boy or girl
asked michael not too hopefully
then he had leapt into her arms
such a little thing for mr
darling and nana to recall now but not so little if that was to be
michaels last night in the nursery
they go on with their recollections
it was then that i rushed in like a tornado wasnt it
darling would say scorning himself and indeed he had been like a tornado
perhaps there was some excuse for him
he too had been dressing for the party and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie
it is an astounding thing to have to tell but this man though he knew about stocks and shares had no real mastery of his tie
sometimes the thing yielded to him without a contest but there were occasions when it would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride and used a madeup tie
this was such an occasion
he came rushing into the nursery with the crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand
why what is the matter father dear
he yelled he really yelled
this tie it will not tie
he became dangerously sarcastic
not round my neck
round the bedpost
oh yes twenty times have i made it up round the bedpost but round my neck no
oh dear no
begs to be excused
he thought mrs
even then mrs
darling was placid
let me try dear she said and indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do and with her nice cool hands she tied his tie for him while the children stood around to see their fate decided
some men would have resented her being able to do it so easily but mr
darling had far too fine a nature for that he thanked her carelessly at once forgot his rage and in another moment was dancing round the room with michael on his back
how wildly we romped
darling now recalling it
our last romp
darling groaned
o george do you remember michael suddenly said to me how did you get to know me mother
i remember
they were rather sweet dont you think george
and they were ours ours
and now they are gone
the romp had ended with the appearance of nana and most unluckily mr
darling collided against her covering his trousers with hairs
they were not only new trousers but they were the first he had ever had with braid on them and he had had to bite his lip to prevent the tears coming
of course mrs
darling brushed him but he began to talk again about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse
george nana is a treasure
no doubt but i have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon the children as puppies
oh no dear one i feel sure she knows they have souls
i wonder mr
darling said thoughtfully i wonder
it was an opportunity his wife felt for telling him about the boy
at first he poohpoohed the story but he became thoughtful when she showed him the shadow
it is nobody i know he said examining it carefully but it does look a scoundrel
we were still discussing it you remember says mr
darling when
nana came in with michaels medicine
you will never carry the bottle in your mouth again nana and it is all my fault
strong man though he was there is no doubt that he had behaved rather foolishly over the medicine
if he had a weakness it was for thinking that all his life he had taken medicine boldly and so now when
michael dodged the spoon in nanas mouth he had said reprovingly be a man michael
michael cried naughtily
darling left the room to get a chocolate for him and mr
darling thought this showed want of firmness
mother dont pamper him he called after her
michael when i was your age i took medicine without a murmur
i said thank you kind parents for giving me bottles to make me well
he really thought this was true and wendy who was now in her nightgown believed it also and she said to encourage michael that medicine you sometimes take father is much nastier isnt it
ever so much nastier mr
darling said bravely and i would take it now as an example to you michael if i hadnt lost the bottle
he had not exactly lost it he had climbed in the dead of night to the top of the wardrobe and hidden it there
what he did not know was that the faithful liza had found it and put it back on his washstand
i know where it is father wendy cried always glad to be of service
ill bring it and she was off before he could stop her
immediately his spirits sank in the strangest way
john he said shuddering its most beastly stuff
its that nasty sticky sweet kind
it will soon be over father john said cheerily and then in rushed
wendy with the medicine in a glass
i have been as quick as i could she panted
you have been wonderfully quick her father retorted with a vindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her
michael first he said doggedly
father first said michael who was of a suspicious nature
i shall be sick you know mr
darling said threateningly
come on father said john
hold your tongue john his father rapped out
wendy was quite puzzled
i thought you took it quite easily father
that is not the point he retorted
the point is that there is more in my glass than in michaels spoon
his proud heart was nearly bursting
and it isnt fair i would say it though it were with my last breath it isnt fair
father i am waiting said michael coldly
its all very well to say you are waiting so am i waiting
fathers a cowardly custard
so are you a cowardly custard
im not frightened
neither am i frightened
well then take it
well then you take it
wendy had a splendid idea
why not both take it at the same time
certainly said mr
are you ready michael
wendy gave the words one two three and michael took his medicine but mr
darling slipped his behind his back
there was a yell of rage from michael and o father
wendy exclaimed
what do you mean by o father
darling demanded
stop that row
i meant to take mine but ii missed it
it was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him just as if they did not admire him
look here all of you he said entreatingly as soon as nana had gone into the bathroom
i have just thought of a splendid joke
i shall pour my medicine into nanas bowl and she will drink it thinking it is milk
it was the colour of milk but the children did not have their fathers sense of humour and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the medicine into nanas bowl
he said doubtfully and they did not dare expose him when mrs
darling and nana returned
nana good dog he said patting her i have put a little milk into your bowl nana
nana wagged her tail ran to the medicine and began lapping it
then she gave mr
darling such a look not an angry look she showed him the great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs and crept into her kennel
darling was frightfully ashamed of himself but he would not give in
in a horrid silence mrs
darling smelt the bowl
o george she said its your medicine
it was only a joke he roared while she comforted her boys and
wendy hugged nana
much good he said bitterly my wearing myself to the bone trying to be funny in this house
and still wendy hugged nana
thats right he shouted
coddle her
nobody coddles me
oh dear no
i am only the breadwinner why should i be coddledwhy why why
george mrs
darling entreated him not so loud the servants will hear you
somehow they had got into the way of calling liza the servants
he answered recklessly
bring in the whole world
but i refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour longer
the children wept and nana ran to him beseechingly but he waved her back
he felt he was a strong man again
in vain in vain he cried the proper place for you is the yard and there you go to be tied up this instant
george george mrs
darling whispered remember what i told you about that boy
alas he would not listen
he was ashamed of himself and yet he did it
it was all owing to his too affectionate nature which craved for admiration
when he had tied her up in the backyard the wretched father went and sat in the passage with his knuckles to his eyes
in the meantime mrs
darling had put the children to bed in unwonted silence and lit their nightlights
they could hear nana barking and
john whimpered it is because he is chaining her up in the yard but
wendy was wiser
that is not nanas unhappy bark she said little guessing what was about to happen that is her bark when she smells danger
are you sure wendy
darling quivered and went to the window
it was securely fastened
she looked out and the night was peppered with stars
they were crowding round the house as if curious to see what was to take place there but she did not notice this nor that one or two of the smaller ones winked at her
yet a nameless fear clutched at her heart and made her cry oh how i wish that i wasnt going to a party tonight
even michael already half asleep knew that she was perturbed and he asked can anything harm us mother after the nightlights are lit
nothing precious she said they are the eyes a mother leaves behind her to guard her children
she went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them and little
michael flung his arms round her
mother he cried im glad of you
they were the last words she was to hear from him for a long time
was only a few yards distant but there had been a slight fall of snow and father and mother darling picked their way over it deftly not to soil their shoes
they were already the only persons in the street and all the stars were watching them
stars are beautiful but they may not take an active part in anything they must just look on for ever
it is a punishment put on them for something they did so long ago that no star now knows what it was
so the older ones have become glassyeyed and seldom speak winking is the star language but the little ones still wonder
so as soon as the door of closed on mr
darling there was a commotion in the firmament and the smallest of all the stars in the milky way screamed out now peter
chapter iii
come away come away
for a moment after mr
darling left the house the nightlights by the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly
it was not really a light it made this light by flashing about so quickly but when it came to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy no longer than your hand but still growing
it was a girl called tinker bell exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf cut low and square through which her figure could be seen to the best advantage
she was slightly inclined to embonpoint
a moment after the fairys entrance the window was blown open by the breathing of the little stars and peter dropped in
he had carried
tinker bell part of the way and his hand was still messy with the fairy dust
tinker bell he called softly after making sure that the children were asleep tink where are you
she was in a jug for the moment and liking it extremely she had never been in a jug before
oh do come out of that jug and tell me do you know where they put my shadow
the loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him
it is the fairy language
you ordinary children can never hear it but if you were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once before
tink said that the shadow was in the big box
she meant the chest of drawers and peter jumped at the drawers scattering their contents to the floor with both hands as kings toss hapence to the crowd
in a moment he had recovered his shadow and in his delight he forgot that he had shut tinker bell up in the drawer
if he thought at all but i dont believe he ever thought it was that he and his shadow when brought near each other would join like drops of water and when they did not he was appalled
he tried to stick it on with soap from the bathroom but that also failed
a shudder passed through peter and he sat on the floor and cried
his sobs woke wendy and she sat up in bed
she was not alarmed to see a stranger crying on the nursery floor she was only pleasantly interested
boy she said courteously why are you crying
peter could be exceeding polite also having learned the grand manner at fairy ceremonies and he rose and bowed to her beautifully
she was much pleased and bowed beautifully to him from the bed
whats your name
wendy moira angela darling she replied with some satisfaction
what is your name
she was already sure that he must be peter but it did seem a comparatively short name
is that all
yes he said rather sharply
he felt for the first time that it was a shortish name
im so sorry said wendy moira angela
it doesnt matter peter gulped
she asked where he lived
second to the right said peter and then straight on till morning
what a funny address
peter had a sinking
for the first time he felt that perhaps it was a funny address
no it isnt he said
i mean wendy said nicely remembering that she was hostess is that what they put on the letters
he wished she had not mentioned letters
dont get any letters he said contemptuously
but your mother gets letters
dont have a mother he said
not only had he no mother but he had not the slightest desire to have one
he thought them very overrated persons
wendy however felt at once that she was in the presence of a tragedy
o peter no wonder you were crying she said and got out of bed and ran to him
i wasnt crying about mothers he said rather indignantly
i was crying because i cant get my shadow to stick on
besides i wasnt crying
it has come off
then wendy saw the shadow on the floor looking so draggled and she was frightfully sorry for peter
she said but she could not help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with soap
how exactly like a boy
fortunately she knew at once what to do
it must be sewn on she said just a little patronisingly
whats sewn
youre dreadfully ignorant
but she was exulting in his ignorance
i shall sew it on for you my little man she said though he was tall as herself and she got out her housewife and sewed the shadow on to peters foot
i daresay it will hurt a little she warned him
oh i shant cry said peter who was already of the opinion that he had never cried in his life
and he clenched his teeth and did not cry and soon his shadow was behaving properly though still a little creased
perhaps i should have ironed it wendy said thoughtfully but peter boylike was indifferent to appearances and he was now jumping about in the wildest glee
alas he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss to wendy
he thought he had attached the shadow himself
how clever i am
he crowed rapturously oh the cleverness of me
it is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of peter was one of his most fascinating qualities
to put it with brutal frankness there never was a cockier boy
but for the moment wendy was shocked
you conceit she exclaimed with frightful sarcasm of course i did nothing
you did a little peter said carelessly and continued to dance
she replied with hauteur if i am no use i can at least withdraw and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed and covered her face with the blankets
to induce her to look up he pretended to be going away and when this failed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his foot
wendy he said dont withdraw
i cant help crowing wendy when im pleased with myself
still she would not look up though she was listening eagerly
wendy he continued in a voice that no woman has ever yet been able to resist wendy one girl is more use than twenty boys
now wendy was every inch a woman though there were not very many inches and she peeped out of the bedclothes
do you really think so peter
i think its perfectly sweet of you she declared and ill get up again and she sat with him on the side of the bed
she also said she would give him a kiss if he liked but peter did not know what she meant and he held out his hand expectantly
surely you know what a kiss is
she asked aghast
i shall know when you give it to me he replied stiffly and not to hurt his feeling she gave him a thimble
now said he shall i give you a kiss
and she replied with a slight primness if you please
it was lucky that she did put it on that chain for it was afterwards to save her life
when people in our set are introduced it is customary for them to ask each others age and so wendy who always liked to do the correct thing asked peter how old he was
it was not really a happy question to ask him it was like an examination paper that asks grammar when what you want to be asked is kings of england
i dont know he replied uneasily but i am quite young
he really knew nothing about it he had merely suspicions but he said at a venture wendy i ran away the day i was born
wendy was quite surprised but interested and she indicated in the charming drawingroom manner by a touch on her nightgown that he could sit nearer her
it was because i heard father and mother he explained in a low voice talking about what i was to be when i became a man
he was extraordinarily agitated now
i dont want ever to be a man he said with passion
i want always to be a little boy and to have fun
so i ran away to kensington gardens and lived a long long time among the fairies
she gave him a look of the most intense admiration and he thought it was because he had run away but it was really because he knew fairies
wendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as quite delightful
she poured out questions about them to his surprise for they were rather a nuisance to him getting in his way and so on and indeed he sometimes had to give them a hiding
still he liked them on the whole and he told her about the beginning of fairies
you see wendy when the first baby laughed for the first time its laugh broke into a thousand pieces and they all went skipping about and that was the beginning of fairies
tedious talk this but being a stayathome she liked it
and so he went on goodnaturedly there ought to be one fairy for every boy and girl
ought to be
isnt there
you see children know such a lot now they soon dont believe in fairies and every time a child says i dont believe in fairies there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead
really he thought they had now talked enough about fairies and it struck him that tinker bell was keeping very quiet
i cant think where she has gone to he said rising and he called tink by name
wendys heart went flutter with a sudden thrill
peter she cried clutching him you dont mean to tell me that there is a fairy in this room
she was here just now he said a little impatiently
you dont hear her do you
and they both listened
the only sound i hear said wendy is like a tinkle of bells
well thats tink thats the fairy language
i think i hear her too
the sound came from the chest of drawers and peter made a merry face
no one could ever look quite so merry as peter and the loveliest of gurgles was his laugh
he had his first laugh still
wendy he whispered gleefully i do believe i shut her up in the drawer
he let poor tink out of the drawer and she flew about the nursery screaming with fury
you shouldnt say such things peter retorted
of course im very sorry but how could i know you were in the drawer
wendy was not listening to him
o peter she cried if she would only stand still and let me see her
they hardly ever stand still he said but for one moment wendy saw the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock
o the lovely
she cried though tinks face was still distorted with passion
tink said peter amiably this lady says she wishes you were her fairy
tinker bell answered insolently
what does she say peter
he had to translate
she is not very polite
she says you are a great ugly girl and that she is my fairy
he tried to argue with tink
you know you cant be my fairy tink because i am an gentleman and you are a lady
to this tink replied in these words you silly ass and disappeared into the bathroom
she is quite a common fairy peter explained apologetically she is called tinker bell because she mends the pots and kettles
they were together in the armchair by this time and wendy plied him with more questions
if you dont live in kensington gardens now sometimes i do still
but where do you live mostly now
with the lost boys
who are they
they are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the nurse is looking the other way
if they are not claimed in seven days they are sent far away to the neverland to defray expenses
im captain
what fun it must be
yes said cunning peter but we are rather lonely
you see we have no female companionship
are none of the others girls
oh no girls you know are much too clever to fall out of their prams
this flattered wendy immensely
i think she said it is perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls john there just despises us
for reply peter rose and kicked john out of bed blankets and all one kick
this seemed to wendy rather forward for a first meeting and she told him with spirit that he was not captain in her house
john continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she allowed him to remain there
and i know you meant to be kind she said relenting so you may give me a kiss
for the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses
i thought you would want it back he said a little bitterly and offered to return her the thimble
oh dear said the nice wendy i dont mean a kiss i mean a thimble
whats that
its like this
she kissed him
said peter gravely
now shall i give you a thimble
if you wish to said wendy keeping her head erect this time
peter thimbled her and almost immediately she screeched
what is it
it was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair
that must have been tink
i never knew her so naughty before
and indeed tink was darting about again using offensive language
she says she will do that to you wendy every time i give you a thimble
again tink replied you silly ass
peter could not understand why but wendy understood and she was just slightly disappointed when he admitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen to stories
you see i dont know any stories
none of the lost boys knows any stories
how perfectly awful wendy said
do you know peter asked why swallows build in the eaves of houses
it is to listen to the stories
o wendy your mother was telling you such a lovely story
which story was it
about the prince who couldnt find the lady who wore the glass slipper
peter said wendy excitedly that was cinderella and he found her and they lived happily ever after
peter was so glad that he rose from the floor where they had been sitting and hurried to the window
where are you going
she cried with misgiving
to tell the other boys
dont go peter she entreated i know such lots of stories
those were her precise words so there can be no denying that it was she who first tempted him
he came back and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to have alarmed her but did not
oh the stories i could tell to the boys
she cried and then peter gripped her and began to draw her toward the window
she ordered him
wendy do come with me and tell the other boys
of course she was very pleased to be asked but she said oh dear i cant
think of mummy
besides i cant fly
ill teach you
oh how lovely to fly
ill teach you how to jump on the winds back and then away we go
she exclaimed rapturously
wendy wendy when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be flying about with me saying funny things to the stars
and wendy there are mermaids
with tails
such long tails
oh cried wendy to see a mermaid
he had become frightfully cunning
wendy he said how we should all respect you
she was wriggling her body in distress
it was quite as if she were trying to remain on the nursery floor
but he had no pity for her
wendy he said the sly one you could tuck us in at night
none of us has ever been tucked in at night
oo and her arms went out to him
and you could darn our clothes and make pockets for us
none of us has any pockets
how could she resist
of course its awfully fascinating
peter would you teach john and michael to fly too
if you like he said indifferently and she ran to john and michael and shook them
wake up she cried peter pan has come and he is to teach us to fly
john rubbed his eyes
then i shall get up he said
of course he was on the floor already
hallo he said i am up
michael was up by this time also looking as sharp as a knife with six blades and a saw but peter suddenly signed silence
their faces assumed the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the grownup world
all was as still as salt
then everything was right
everything was wrong
nana who had been barking distressfully all the evening was quiet now
it was her silence they had heard
out with the light
cried john taking command for the only time throughout the whole adventure
and thus when liza entered holding nana the nursery seemed quite its old self very dark and you would have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing angelically as they slept
they were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtains
liza was in a bad temper for she was mixing the christmas puddings in the kitchen and had been drawn from them with a raisin still on her cheek by nanas absurd suspicions
she thought the best way of getting a little quiet was to take nana to the nursery for a moment but in custody of course
there you suspicious brute she said not sorry that nana was in disgrace
they are perfectly safe arent they
every one of the little angels sound asleep in bed
listen to their gentle breathing
here michael encouraged by his success breathed so loudly that they were nearly detected
nana knew that kind of breathing and she tried to drag herself out of lizas clutches
but liza was dense
no more of it nana she said sternly pulling her out of the room
i warn you if you bark again i shall go straight for master and missus and bring them home from the party and then oh wont master whip you just
she tied the unhappy dog up again but do you think nana ceased to bark
bring master and missus home from the party
why that was just what she wanted
do you think she cared whether she was whipped so long as her charges were safe
unfortunately liza returned to her puddings and nana seeing that no help would come from her strained and strained at the chain until at last she broke it
in another moment she had burst into the diningroom of and flung up her paws to heaven her most expressive way of making a communication
darling knew at once that something terrible was happening in their nursery and without a goodbye to their hostess they rushed into the street
but it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing behind the curtains and peter pan can do a great deal in ten minutes
we now return to the nursery
its all right john announced emerging from his hidingplace
i say peter can you really fly
instead of troubling to answer him peter flew around the room taking the mantelpiece on the way
how topping
said john and michael
cried wendy
yes im sweet oh i am sweet
said peter forgetting his manners again
it looked delightfully easy and they tried it first from the floor and then from the beds but they always went down instead of up
i say how do you do it
asked john rubbing his knee
he was quite a practical boy
you just think lovely wonderful thoughts peter explained and they lift you up in the air
he showed them again
youre so nippy at it john said couldnt you do it very slowly once
peter did it both slowly and quickly
ive got it now wendy
john but soon he found he had not
not one of them could fly an inch though even michael was in words of two syllables and peter did not know a from z
of course peter had been trifling with them for no one can fly unless the fairy dust has been blown on him
fortunately as we have mentioned one of his hands was messy with it and he blew some on each of them with the most superb results
now just wiggle your shoulders this way he said and let go
they were all on their beds and gallant michael let go first
he did not quite mean to let go but he did it and immediately he was borne across the room
he screamed while still in midair
john let go and met wendy near the bathroom
oh ripping
look at me
look at me
look at me
they were not nearly so elegant as peter they could not help kicking a little but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling and there is almost nothing so delicious as that
peter gave wendy a hand at first but had to desist tink was so indignant
up and down they went and round and round
heavenly was wendys word
i say cried john why shouldnt we all go out
of course it was to this that peter had been luring them
michael was ready he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion miles
but wendy hesitated
said peter again
and there are pirates
pirates cried john seizing his sunday hat let us go at once
it was just at this moment that mr
darling hurried with nana out of
not three figures four
in a tremble they opened the street door
darling would have rushed upstairs but mrs
darling signed him to go softly
she even tried to make her heart go softly
will they reach the nursery in time
if so how delightful for them and we shall all breathe a sigh of relief but there will be no story
on the other hand if they are not in time i solemnly promise that it will all come right in the end
they would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the little stars were watching them
once again the stars blew the window open and that smallest star of all called out cave peter
then peter knew that there was not a moment to lose
come he cried imperiously and soared out at once into the night followed by john and michael and wendy
darling and nana rushed into the nursery too late
the birds were flown
chapter iv
the flight second to the right and straight on till morning
that peter had told wendy was the way to the neverland but even birds carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners could not have sighted it with these instructions
peter you see just said anything that came into his head
at first his companions trusted him implicitly and so great were the delights of flying that they wasted time circling round church spires or any other tall objects on the way that took their fancy
john and michael raced michael getting a start
they recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought themselves fine fellows for being able to fly round a room
not long ago
but how long ago
they were flying over the sea before this thought began to disturb wendy seriously
john thought it was their second sea and their third night
sometimes it was dark and sometimes light and now they were very cold and again too warm
did they really feel hungry at times or were they merely pretending because peter had such a jolly new way of feeding them
but wendy noticed with gentle concern that peter did not seem to know that this was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter nor even that there are other ways
certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy they were sleepy and that was a danger for the moment they popped off down they fell
the awful thing was that peter thought this funny
there he goes again
he would cry gleefully as michael suddenly dropped like a stone
save him save him
cried wendy looking with horror at the cruel sea far below
eventually peter would dive through the air and catch
also he was fond of variety and the sport that engrossed him one moment would suddenly cease to engage him so there was always the possibility that the next time you fell he would let you go
he could sleep in the air without falling by merely lying on his back and floating but this was partly at least because he was so light that if you got behind him and blew he went faster
do be more polite to him wendy whispered to john when they were playing follow my leader
then tell him to stop showing off said john
when playing follow my leader peter would fly close to the water and touch each sharks tail in passing just as in the street you may run your finger along an iron railing
they could not follow him in this with much success so perhaps it was rather like showing off especially as he kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed
you must be nice to him wendy impressed on her brothers
what could we do if he were to leave us
we could go back michael said
how could we ever find our way back without him
well then we could go on said john
that is the awful thing john
we should have to go on for we dont know how to stop
this was true peter had forgotten to show them how to stop
john said that if the worst came to the worst all they had to do was to go straight on for the world was round and so in time they must come back to their own window
and who is to get food for us john
i nipped a bit out of that eagles mouth pretty neatly wendy
after the twentieth try wendy reminded him
and even though we became good at picking up food see how we bump against clouds and things if he is not near to give us a hand
indeed they were constantly bumping
they could now fly strongly though they still kicked far too much but if they saw a cloud in front of them the more they tried to avoid it the more certainly did they bump into it
if nana had been with them she would have had a bandage round michaels forehead by this time
peter was not with them for the moment and they felt rather lonely up there by themselves
he could go so much faster than they that he would suddenly shoot out of sight to have some adventure in which they had no share
it was really rather irritating to children who had never seen a mermaid
and if he forgets them so quickly wendy argued how can we expect that he will go on remembering us
indeed sometimes when he returned he did not remember them at least not well
wendy was sure of it
she saw recognition come into his eyes as he was about to pass them the time of day and go on once even she had to call him by name
im wendy she said agitatedly
he was very sorry
i say wendy he whispered to her always if you see me forgetting you just keep on saying im wendy and then ill remember
of course this was rather unsatisfactory
indeed they would have slept longer but peter tired quickly of sleeping and soon he would cry in his captain voice we get off here
so with occasional tiffs but on the whole rollicking they drew near the
it is only thus that any one may sight those magic shores
there it is said peter calmly
where where
where all the arrows are pointing
indeed a million golden arrows were pointing it out to the children all directed by their friend the sun who wanted them to be sure of their way before leaving them for the night
wendy and john and michael stood on tiptoe in the air to get their first sight of the island
john theres the lagoon
wendy look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand
i say john i see your flamingo with the broken leg
look michael theres your cave
john whats that in the brushwood
its a wolf with her whelps
wendy i do believe thats your little whelp
theres my boat john with her sides stove in
no it isnt
why we burned your boat
thats her at any rate
i say john i see the smoke of the redskin camp
show me and ill tell you by the way smoke curls whether they are on the warpath
there just across the mysterious river
yes they are on the warpath right enough
peter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much but if he wanted to lord it over them his triumph was at hand for have i not told you that anon fear fell upon them
it came as the arrows went leaving the island in gloom
in the old days at home the neverland had always begun to look a little dark and threatening by bedtime
then unexplored patches arose in it and spread black shadows moved about in them the roar of the beasts of prey was quite different now and above all you lost the certainty that you would win
you were quite glad that the nightlights were on
you even liked nana to say that this was just the mantelpiece over here and that the neverland was all makebelieve
of course the neverland had been makebelieve in those days but it was real now and there were no nightlights and it was getting darker every moment and where was nana
they had been flying apart but they huddled close to peter now
his careless manner had gone at last his eyes were sparkling and a tingle went through them every time they touched his body
they were now over the fearsome island flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their feet
nothing horrid was visible in the air yet their progress had become slow and laboured exactly as if they were pushing their way through hostile forces
sometimes they hung in the air until peter had beaten on it with his fists
they dont want us to land he explained
who are they
wendy whispered shuddering
but he could not or would not say
tinker bell had been asleep on his shoulder but now he wakened her and sent her on in front
sometimes he poised himself in the air listening intently with his hand to his ear and again he would stare down with eyes so bright that they seemed to bore two holes to earth
having done these things he went on again
his courage was almost appalling
would you like an adventure now he said casually to john or would you like to have your tea first
wendy said tea first quickly and michael pressed her hand in gratitude but the braver john hesitated
what kind of adventure
he asked cautiously
theres a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us peter told him
if you like well go down and kill him
i dont see him john said after a long pause
suppose john said a little huskily he were to wake up
peter spoke indignantly
you dont think i would kill him while he was sleeping
i would wake him first and then kill him
thats the way i always do
do you kill many
john said how ripping but decided to have tea first
he asked if there were many pirates on the island just now and peter said he had never known so many
who is captain now
hook answered peter and his face became very stern as he said that hated word
then indeed michael began to cry and even john could speak in gulps only for they knew hooks reputation
he was blackbeards bosun john whispered huskily
he is the worst of them all
he is the only man of whom barbecue was afraid
thats him said peter
what is he like
he is not so big as he was
how do you mean
i cut off a bit of him
yes me said peter sharply
i wasnt meaning to be disrespectful
oh all right
but i say what bit
his right hand
then he cant fight now
oh cant he just
lefthander
he has an iron hook instead of a right hand and he claws with it
i say john said peter
say ay ay sir
there is one thing peter continued that every boy who serves under me has to promise and so must you
john paled
it is this if we meet hook in open fight you must leave him to me
i promise john said loyally
for the moment they were feeling less eerie because tink was flying with them and in her light they could distinguish each other
unfortunately she could not fly so slowly as they and so she had to go round and round them in a circle in which they moved as in a halo
wendy quite liked it until peter pointed out the drawbacks
she tells me he said that the pirates sighted us before the darkness came and got long tom out
the big gun
and of course they must see her light and if they guess we are near it they are sure to let fly
tell her to go away at once peter the three cried simultaneously but he refused
she thinks we have lost the way he replied stiffly and she is rather frightened
you dont think i would send her away all by herself when she is frightened
for a moment the circle of light was broken and something gave peter a loving little pinch
then tell her wendy begged to put out her light
she cant put it out
that is about the only thing fairies cant do
it just goes out of itself when she falls asleep same as the stars
then tell her to sleep at once john almost ordered
she cant sleep except when shes sleepy
it is the only other thing fairies cant do
seems to me growled john these are the only two things worth doing
here he got a pinch but not a loving one
if only one of us had a pocket peter said we could carry her in it
however they had set off in such a hurry that there was not a pocket between the four of them
he had a happy idea
tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand
john carried it though she had hoped to be carried by peter
wendy took the hat because john said it struck against his knee as he flew and this as we shall see led to mischief for tinker bell hated to be under an obligation to wendy
in the black topper the light was completely hidden and they flew on in silence
even these noises ceased
to michael the loneliness was dreadful
if only something would make a sound
as if in answer to his request the air was rent by the most tremendous crash he had ever heard
the pirates had fired long tom at them
the roar of it echoed through the mountains and the echoes seemed to cry savagely where are they where are they where are they
thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an island of makebelieve and the same island come true
when at last the heavens were steady again john and michael found themselves alone in the darkness
john was treading the air mechanically and michael without knowing how to float was floating
are you shot
john whispered tremulously
i havent tried yet michael whispered back
we know now that no one had been hit
peter however had been carried by the wind of the shot far out to sea while wendy was blown upwards with no companion but tinker bell
it would have been well for wendy if at that moment she had dropped the hat
i dont know whether the idea came suddenly to tink or whether she had planned it on the way but she at once popped out of the hat and began to lure wendy to her destruction
tink was not all bad or rather she was all bad just now but on the other hand sometimes she was all good
fairies have to be one thing or the other because being so small they unfortunately have room for one feeling only at a time
they are however allowed to change only it must be a complete change
at present she was full of jealousy of
what else could poor wendy do
she called to peter and john and
michael and got only mocking echoes in reply
she did not yet know that tink hated her with the fierce hatred of a very woman
and so bewildered and now staggering in her flight she followed tink to her doom
the island come true
feeling that peter was on his way back the neverland had again woke into life
we ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened but woke is better and was always used by peter
in his absence things are usually quiet on the island
but with the coming of peter who hates lethargy they are under way again if you put your ear to the ground now you would hear the whole island seething with life
on this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as follows
the lost boys were out looking for peter the pirates were out looking for the lost boys the redskins were out looking for the pirates and the beasts were out looking for the redskins
they were going round and round the island but they did not meet because all were going at the same rate
all wanted blood except the boys who liked it as a rule but tonight were out to greet their captain
let us pretend to lie here among the sugarcane and watch them as they steal by in single file each with his hand on his dagger
they are forbidden by peter to look in the least like him and they wear the skins of the bears slain by themselves in which they are so round and furry that when they fall they roll
they have therefore become very surefooted
the first to pass is tootles not the least brave but the most unfortunate of all that gallant band
this illluck had given a gentle melancholy to his countenance but instead of souring his nature had sweetened it so that he was quite the humblest of the boys
poor kind tootles there is danger in the air for you tonight
take care lest an adventure is now offered you which if accepted will plunge you in deepest woe
tootles the fairy tink who is bent on mischief this night is looking for a tool and she thinks you are the most easily tricked of the boys
ware tinker bell
would that he could hear us but we are not really on the island and he passes by biting his knuckles
next comes nibs the gay and debonair followed by slightly who cuts whistles out of the trees and dances ecstatically to his own tunes
slightly is the most conceited of the boys
he thinks he remembers the days before he was lost with their manners and customs and this has given his nose an offensive tilt
last come the
twins who cannot be described because we should be sure to be describing the wrong one
the boys vanish in the gloom and after a pause but not a long pause for things go briskly on the island come the pirates on their track
we hear them before they are seen and it is always the same dreadful song avast belay yo ho heave to apirating we go
and if were parted by a shot were sure to meet below
a more villainouslooking lot never hung in a row on execution dock
that gigantic black behind him has had many names since he dropped the one with which dusky mothers still terrify their children on the banks of the guadjomo
here is bill jukes every inch of him tattooed the same
skylights morgans skylights and the irish bosun smee an oddly genial man who stabbed so to speak without offence and was the only
nonconformist in hooks crew and noodler whose hands were fixed on backwards and robt
mullins and alf mason and many another ruffian long known and feared on the spanish main
in the midst of them the blackest and largest in that dark setting reclined james hook or as he wrote himself jas
hook of whom it is said he was the only man that the seacook feared
he lay at his ease in a rough chariot drawn and propelled by his men and instead of a right hand he had the iron hook with which ever and anon he encouraged them to increase their pace
as dogs this terrible man treated and addressed them and as dogs they obeyed him
his eyes were of the blue of the forgetmenot and of a profound melancholy save when he was plunging his hook into you at which time two red spots appeared in them and lit them up horribly
in manner something of the grand seigneur still clung to him so that he even ripped you up with an air and i have been told that he was a raconteur of repute
a man of indomitable courage it was said that the only thing he shied at was the sight of his own blood which was thick and of an unusual colour
in dress he somewhat aped the attire associated with the name of
but undoubtedly the grimmest part of him was his iron claw
let us now kill a pirate to show hooks method
skylights will do
as they pass skylights lurches clumsily against him ruffling his lace collar the hook shoots forth there is a tearing sound and one screech then the body is kicked aside and the pirates pass on
he has not even taken the cigars from his mouth
such is the terrible man against whom peter pan is pitted
which will win
on the trail of the pirates stealing noiselessly down the warpath which is not visible to inexperienced eyes come the redskins every one of them with his eyes peeled
they carry tomahawks and knives and their naked bodies gleam with paint and oil
strung around them are scalps of boys as well as of pirates for these are the piccaninny tribe and not to be confused with the softerhearted delawares or the
in the van on all fours is great big little panther a brave of so many scalps that in his present position they somewhat impede his progress
bringing up the rear the place of greatest danger comes
tiger lily proudly erect a princess in her own right
observe how they pass over fallen twigs without making the slightest noise
the only sound to be heard is their somewhat heavy breathing
the fact is that they are all a little fat just now after the heavy gorging but in time they will work this off
for the moment however it constitutes their chief danger
their tongues are hanging out they are hungry tonight
when they have passed comes the last figure of all a gigantic crocodile
we shall see for whom she is looking presently
the crocodile passes but soon the boys appear again for the procession must continue indefinitely until one of the parties stops or changes its pace
then quickly they will be on top of each other
all are keeping a sharp lookout in front but none suspects that the danger may be creeping up from behind
this shows how real the island was
the first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys
they flung themselves down on the sward close to their underground home
i do wish peter would come back every one of them said nervously though in height and still more in breadth they were all larger than their captain
cinderella
they talked of cinderella and tootles was confident that his mother must have been very like her
it was only in peters absence that they could speak of mothers the subject being forbidden by him as silly
all i remember about my mother nibs told them is that she often said to my father oh how i wish i had a chequebook of my own
i dont know what a chequebook is but i should just love to give my mother one
while they talked they heard a distant sound
you or i not being wild things of the woods would have heard nothing but they heard it and it was the grim song yo ho yo ho the pirate life the flag o skull and bones
a merry hour a hempen rope and hey for davy jones
at once the lost boysbut where are they
they are no longer there
rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly
i will tell you where they are
with the exception of nibs who has darted away to reconnoitre they are already in their home under the ground a very delightful residence of which we shall see a good deal presently
but how have they reached it
for there is no entrance to be seen not so much as a large stone which if rolled away would disclose the mouth of a cave
look closely however and you may note that there are here seven large trees each with a hole in its hollow trunk as large as a boy
these are the seven entrances to the home under the ground for which hook has been searching in vain these many moons
will he find it tonight
as the pirates advanced the quick eye of starkey sighted nibs disappearing through the wood and at once his pistol flashed out
but an iron claw gripped his shoulder
captain let go
he cried writhing
now for the first time we hear the voice of hook
it was a black voice
put back that pistol first it said threateningly
it was one of those boys you hate
i could have shot him dead
ay and the sound would have brought tiger lilys redskins upon us
do you want to lose your scalp
shall i after him captain asked pathetic smee and tickle him with
johnny corkscrew
smee had pleasant names for everything and his cutlass was johnny corkscrew because he wiggled it in the wound
one could mention many lovable traits in smee
for instance after killing it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon
johnnys a silent fellow he reminded hook
not now smee hook said darkly
he is only one and i want to mischief all the seven
scatter and look for them
the pirates disappeared among the trees and in a moment their captain and smee were alone
hook heaved a heavy sigh and i know not why it was perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the evening but there came over him a desire to confide to his faithful bosun the story of his life
he spoke long and earnestly but what it was all about smee who was rather stupid did not know in the least
anon he caught the word peter
most of all hook was saying passionately i want their captain
twas he cut off my arm
he brandished the hook threateningly
ive waited long to shake his hand with this
oh ill tear him
and yet said smee i have often heard you say that hook was worth a score of hands for combing the hair and other homely uses
ay the captain answered if i was a mother i would pray to have my children born with this instead of that and he cast a look of pride upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other
then again he frowned
peter flung my arm he said wincing to a crocodile that happened to be passing by
i have often said smee noticed your strange dread of crocodiles
not of crocodiles hook corrected him but of that one crocodile
he lowered his voice
it liked my arm so much smee that it has followed me ever since from sea to sea and from land to land licking its lips for the rest of me
in a way said smee its sort of a compliment
i want no such compliments hook barked petulantly
i want peter
pan who first gave the brute its taste for me
he sat down on a large mushroom and now there was a quiver in his voice
smee he said huskily that crocodile would have had me before this but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick tick inside it and so before it can reach me i hear the tick and bolt
he laughed but in a hollow way
some day said smee the clock will run down and then hell get you
hook wetted his dry lips
ay he said thats the fear that haunts me
since sitting down he had felt curiously warm
smee he said this seat is hot
he jumped up
odds bobs hammer and tongs im burning
they examined the mushroom which was of a size and solidity unknown on the mainland they tried to pull it up and it came away at once in their hands for it had no root
stranger still smoke began at once to ascend
the pirates looked at each other
they both exclaimed
they had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground
it was the custom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were in the neighbourhood
not only smoke came out of it
there came also childrens voices for so safe did the boys feel in their hidingplace that they were gaily chattering
the pirates listened grimly and then replaced the mushroom
they looked around them and noted the holes in the seven trees
did you hear them say peter pans from home
smee whispered fidgeting with johnny corkscrew
hook nodded
he stood for a long time lost in thought and at last a curdling smile lit up his swarthy face
smee had been waiting for it
unrip your plan captain he cried eagerly
to return to the ship hook replied slowly through his teeth and cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it
there can be but one room below for there is but one chimney
the silly moles had not the sense to see that they did not need a door apiece
that shows they have no mother
we will leave the cake on the shore of the mermaids lagoon
these boys are always swimming about there playing with the mermaids
they will find the cake and they will gobble it up because having no mother they dont know how dangerous tis to eat rich damp cake
he burst into laughter not hollow laughter now but honest laughter
aha they will die
smee had listened with growing admiration
its the wickedest prettiest policy ever i heard of
he cried and in their exultation they danced and sang avast belay when i appear by fear theyre overtook
noughts left upon your bones when you have shaken claws with hook
they began the verse but they never finished it for another sound broke in and stilled them
there was at first such a tiny sound that a leaf might have fallen on it and smothered it but as it came nearer it was more distinct
tick tick tick tick
hook stood shuddering one foot in the air
the crocodile
he gasped and bounded away followed by his bosun
it was indeed the crocodile
it had passed the redskins who were now on the trail of the other pirates
it oozed on after hook
once more the boys emerged into the open but the dangers of the night were not yet over for presently nibs rushed breathless into their midst pursued by a pack of wolves
the tongues of the pursuers were hanging out the baying of them was horrible
save me save me
cried nibs falling on the ground
but what can we do what can we do
it was a high compliment to peter that at that dire moment their thoughts turned to him
what would peter do
they cried simultaneously
almost in the same breath they cried peter would look at them through his legs
and then let us do what peter would do
it is quite the most successful way of defying wolves and as one boy they bent and looked through their legs
the next moment is the long one but victory came quickly for as the boys advanced upon them in the terrible attitude the wolves dropped their tails and fled
now nibs rose from the ground and the others thought that his staring eyes still saw the wolves
but it was not wolves he saw
i have seen a wonderfuller thing he cried as they gathered round him eagerly
a great white bird
it is flying this way
what kind of a bird do you think
i dont know nibs said awestruck but it looks so weary and as it flies it moans poor wendy
poor wendy
i remember said slightly instantly there are birds called
see it comes
cried curly pointing to wendy in the heavens
wendy was now almost overhead and they could hear her plaintive cry
but more distinct came the shrill voice of tinker bell
the jealous fairy had now cast off all disguise of friendship and was darting at her victim from every direction pinching savagely each time she touched
hullo tink cried the wondering boys
tinks reply rang out peter wants you to shoot the wendy
it was not in their nature to question when peter ordered
let us do what peter wishes
cried the simple boys
quick bows and arrows
all but tootles popped down their trees
he had a bow and arrow with him and tink noted it and rubbed her little hands
quick tootles quick she screamed
peter will be so pleased
tootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow
out of the way tink he shouted and then he fired and wendy fluttered to the ground with an arrow in her breast
chapter vi
the little house
foolish tootles was standing like a conqueror over wendys body when the other boys sprang armed from their trees
you are too late he cried proudly i have shot the wendy
peter will be so pleased with me
overhead tinker bell shouted silly ass
and darted into hiding
the others did not hear her
they had crowded round wendy and as they looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood
if wendys heart had been beating they would all have heard it
slightly was the first to speak
this is no bird he said in a scared voice
i think this must be a lady
said tootles and fell atrembling
and we have killed her nibs said hoarsely
they all whipped off their caps
now i see curly said peter was bringing her to us
he threw himself sorrowfully on the ground
a lady to take care of us at last said one of the twins and you have killed her
they were sorry for him but sorrier for themselves and when he took a step nearer them they turned from him
tootles face was very white but there was a dignity about him now that had never been there before
i did it he said reflecting
when ladies used to come to me in dreams i said pretty mother pretty mother
but when at last she really came i shot her
he moved slowly away
dont go they called in pity
i must he answered shaking i am so afraid of peter
it was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the heart of every one of them rise to his mouth
they heard peter crow
they cried for it was always thus that he signalled his return
hide her they whispered and gathered hastily around wendy
tootles stood aloof
again came that ringing crow and peter dropped in front of them
greetings boys he cried and mechanically they saluted and then again was silence
he frowned
i am back he said hotly why do you not cheer
they opened their mouths but the cheers would not come
he overlooked it in his haste to tell the glorious tidings
great news boys he cried i have brought at last a mother for you all
still no sound except a little thud from tootles as he dropped on his knees
have you not seen her
asked peter becoming troubled
she flew this way
one voice said and another said oh mournful day
tootles rose
peter he said quietly i will show her to you and when the others would still have hidden her he said back twins let
so they all stood back and let him see and after he had looked for a little time he did not know what to do next
she is dead he said uncomfortably
perhaps she is frightened at being dead
he thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out of sight of her and then never going near the spot any more
they would all have been glad to follow if he had done this
but there was the arrow
he took it from her heart and faced his band
whose arrow
he demanded sternly
mine peter said tootles on his knees
oh dastard hand peter said and he raised the arrow to use it as a dagger
tootles did not flinch
he bared his breast
strike peter he said firmly strike true
twice did peter raise the arrow and twice did his hand fall
i cannot strike he said with awe there is something stays my hand
all looked at him in wonder save nibs who fortunately looked at
it is she he cried the wendy lady see her arm
wonderful to relate wendy had raised her arm
nibs bent over her and listened reverently
i think she said poor tootles he whispered
she lives peter said briefly
slightly cried instantly the wendy lady lives
then peter knelt beside her and found his button
you remember she had put it on a chain that she wore round her neck
see he said the arrow struck against this
it is the kiss i gave her
it has saved her life
i remember kisses slightly interposed quickly let me see it
ay thats a kiss
peter did not hear him
he was begging wendy to get better quickly so that he could show her the mermaids
of course she could not answer yet being still in a frightful faint but from overhead came a wailing note
listen to tink said curly she is crying because the wendy lives
then they had to tell peter of tinks crime and almost never had they seen him look so stern
listen tinker bell he cried i am your friend no more
begone from me for ever
she flew on to his shoulder and pleaded but he brushed her off
not until wendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to say well not for ever but for a whole week
do you think tinker bell was grateful to wendy for raising her arm
oh dear no never wanted to pinch her so much
fairies indeed are strange and peter who understood them best often cuffed them
but what to do with wendy in her present delicate state of health
let us carry her down into the house curly suggested
ay said slightly that is what one does with ladies
no no peter said you must not touch her
it would not be sufficiently respectful
that said slightly is what i was thinking
but if she lies there tootles said she will die
ay she will die slightly admitted but there is no way out
yes there is cried peter
let us build a little house round her
they were all delighted
quick he ordered them bring me each of you the best of what we have
gut our house
in a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a wedding
they skurried this way and that down for bedding up for firewood and while they were at it who should appear but john and michael
as they dragged along the ground they fell asleep standing stopped woke up moved another step and slept again
john john michael would cry wake up
where is nana john and mother
and then john would rub his eyes and mutter it is true we did fly
you may be sure they were very relieved to find peter
hullo peter they said
hullo replied peter amicably though he had quite forgotten them
he was very busy at the moment measuring wendy with his feet to see how large a house she would need
of course he meant to leave room for chairs and a table
john and michael watched him
is wendy asleep
they asked
john michael proposed let us wake her and get her to make supper for us but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on carrying branches for the building of the house
look at them
curly said peter in his most captainy voice see that these boys help in the building of the house
build a house
exclaimed john
for the wendy said curly
john said aghast
why she is only a girl
that explained curly is why we are her servants
wendys servants
yes said peter and you also
away with them
the astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry
chairs and a fender first peter ordered
then we shall build a house round them
ay said slightly that is how a house is built it all comes back to me
peter thought of everything
slightly he cried fetch a doctor
ay ay said slightly at once and disappeared scratching his head
but he knew peter must be obeyed and he returned in a moment wearing
johns hat and looking solemn
please sir said peter going to him are you a doctor
the difference between him and the other boys at such a time was that they knew it was makebelieve while to him makebelieve and true were exactly the same thing
this sometimes troubled them as when they had to makebelieve that they had had their dinners
if they broke down in their makebelieve he rapped them on the knuckles
yes my little man slightly anxiously replied who had chapped knuckles
please sir peter explained a lady lies very ill
she was lying at their feet but slightly had the sense not to see her
tut tut tut he said where does she lie
in yonder glade
i will put a glass thing in her mouth said slightly and he madebelieve to do it while peter waited
it was an anxious moment when the glass thing was withdrawn
how is she
inquired peter
tut tut tut said slightly this has cured her
peter cried
i will call again in the evening slightly said give her beef tea out of a cup with a spout to it but after he had returned the hat to
john he blew big breaths which was his habit on escaping from a difficulty
in the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes almost everything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at wendys feet
if only we knew said one the kind of house she likes best
peter shouted another she is moving in her sleep
her mouth opens cried a third looking respectfully into it
perhaps she is going to sing in her sleep said peter
wendy sing the kind of house you would like to have
immediately without opening her eyes wendy began to sing i wish i had a pretty house the littlest ever seen
with funny little red walls and roof of mossy green
they gurgled with joy at this for by the greatest good luck the branches they had brought were sticky with red sap and all the ground was carpeted with moss
as they rattled up the little house they broke into song themselves weve built the little walls and roof and made a lovely door
so tell us mother wendy what are you wanting more
to this she answered greedily oh really next i think ill have gay windows all about
with roses peeping in you know and babies peeping out
with a blow of their fists they made windows and large yellow leaves were the blinds
roses cried peter sternly
quickly they madebelieve to grow the loveliest roses up the walls
to prevent peter ordering babies they hurried into song again weve made the roses peeping out the babes are at the door
we cannot make ourselves you know cos weve been made before
peter seeing this to be a good idea at once pretended that it was his own
the house was quite beautiful and no doubt wendy was very cosy within though of course they could no longer see her
peter strode up and down ordering finishing touches
nothing escaped his eagle eyes
just when it seemed absolutely finished theres no knocker on the door he said
they were very ashamed but tootles gave the sole of his shoe and it made an excellent knocker
absolutely finished now they thought
not of bit of it
theres no chimney peter said we must have a chimney
it certainly does need a chimney said john importantly
peter an idea
he snatched the hat off johns head knocked out the bottom and put the hat on the roof
the little house was so pleased to have such a capital chimney that as if to say thank you smoke immediately began to come out of the hat
now really and truly it was finished
nothing remained to do but to knock
all look your best peter warned them first impressions are awfully important
he was glad no one asked him what first impressions are they were all too busy looking their best
he knocked politely and now the wood was as still as the children not a sound to be heard except from tinker bell who was watching from a branch and openly sneering
what the boys were wondering was would any one answer the knock
if a lady what would she be like
the door opened and a lady came out
it was wendy
they all whipped off their hats
she looked properly surprised and this was just how they had hoped she would look
where am i
of course slightly was the first to get his word in
wendy lady he said rapidly for you we built this house
oh say youre pleased cried nibs
lovely darling house wendy said and they were the very words they had hoped she would say
and we are your children cried the twins
then all went on their knees and holding out their arms cried o
wendy lady be our mother
wendy said all shining
of course its frightfully fascinating but you see i am only a little girl
i have no real experience
that doesnt matter said peter as if he were the only person present who knew all about it though he was really the one who knew least
what we need is just a nice motherly person
wendy said you see i feel that is exactly what i am
it is it is they all cried we saw it at once
very well she said i will do my best
come inside at once you naughty children i am sure your feet are damp
and before i put you to bed i have just time to finish the story of cinderella
in they went i dont know how there was room for them but you can squeeze very tight in the neverland
and that was the first of the many joyous evenings they had with wendy
the little house looked so cosy and safe in the darkness with a bright light showing through its blinds and the chimney smoking beautifully and peter standing on guard
after a time he fell asleep and some unsteady fairies had to climb over him on their way home from an orgy
any of the other boys obstructing the fairy path at night they would have mischiefed but they just tweaked
peters nose and passed on
chapter vii
the home under the ground
one of the first things peter did next day was to measure wendy and
john and michael for hollow trees
once you fitted you drew in your breath at the top and down you went at exactly the right speed while to ascend you drew in and let out alternately and so wriggled up
of course when you have mastered the action you are able to do these things without thinking of them and nothing can be more graceful
once you fit great care must be taken to go on fitting and this as wendy was to discover to her delight keeps a whole family in perfect condition
wendy and michael fitted their trees at the first try but john had to be altered a little
after a few days practice they could go up and down as gaily as buckets in a well
and how ardently they grew to love their home under the ground especially wendy
a never tree tried hard to grow in the centre of the room but every morning they sawed the trunk through level with the floor
there was an enormous fireplace which was in almost any part of the room where you cared to light it and across this wendy stretched strings made of fibre from which she suspended her washing
the bed was tilted against the wall by day and let down at when it filled nearly half the room and all the boys slept in it except michael lying like sardines in a tin
there was a strict rule against turning round until one gave the signal when all turned at once
michael should have used it also but wendy would have a baby and he was the littlest and you know what women are and the short and long of it is that he was hung up in a basket
it was rough and simple and not unlike what baby bears would have made of an underground house in the same circumstances
but there was one recess in the wall no larger than a birdcage which was the private apartment of tinker bell
it could be shut off from the rest of the house by a tiny curtain which tink who was most fastidious always kept drawn when dressing or undressing
no woman however large could have had a more exquisite boudoir and bedchamber combined
the couch as she always called it was a genuine queen mab with club legs and she varied the bedspreads according to what fruitblossom was in season
there was a chandelier from tiddlywinks for the look of the thing but of course she lit the residence herself
tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the house as indeed was perhaps inevitable and her chamber though beautiful looked rather conceited having the appearance of a nose permanently turned up
i suppose it was all especially entrancing to wendy because those rampagious boys of hers gave her so much to do
really there were whole weeks when except perhaps with a stocking in the evening she was never above ground
the cooking i can tell you kept her nose to the pot and even if there was nothing in it even if there was no pot she had to keep watching that it came aboil just the same
makebelieve was so real to him that during a meal of it you could see him getting rounder
of course it was trying but you simply had to follow his lead and if you could prove to him that you were getting loose for your tree he let you stodge
wendys favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all gone to bed
when she sat down to a basketful of their stockings every heel with a hole in it she would fling up her arms and exclaim oh dear i am sure i sometimes think spinsters are to be envied
her face beamed when she exclaimed this
you remember about her pet wolf
well it very soon discovered that she had come to the island and it found her out and they just ran into each others arms
after that it followed her about everywhere
as time wore on did she think much about the beloved parents she had left behind her
what did disturb her at times was that john remembered his parents vaguely only as people he had once known while
michael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother
they were the most ordinary questionswhat was the colour of mothers eyes
which was taller
father or mother
was mother blonde or brunette
answer all three questions if possible
a write an essay of not less than words on how i spent my last holidays or the characters of father and mother compared
only one of these to be attempted
or describe mothers laugh describe fathers laugh describe mothers party dress describe the kennel and its inmate
they were just everyday questions like these and when you could not answer them you were told to make a cross and it was really dreadful what a number of crosses even john made
peter did not compete
for one thing he despised all mothers except
wendy and for another he was the only boy on the island who could neither write nor spell not the smallest word
he was above all that sort of thing
by the way the questions were all written in the past tense
what was the colour of mothers eyes and so on
wendy you see had been forgetting too
to see peter doing nothing on a stool was a great sight he could not help looking solemn at such times to sit still seemed to him such a comic thing to do
he boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his health
for several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to him and john and michael had to pretend to be delighted also otherwise he would have treated them severely
he often went out alone and when he came back you were never absolutely certain whether he had had an adventure or not
sometimes he came home with his head bandaged and then wendy cooed over him and bathed it in lukewarm water while he told a dazzling tale
but she was never quite sure you know
to describe them all would require a book as large as an englishlatin latinenglish
dictionary and the most we can do is to give one as a specimen of an average hour on the island
the difficulty is which one to choose
should we take the brush with the redskins at slightly gulch
it was a sanguinary affair and especially interesting as showing one of peters peculiarities which was that in the middle of a fight he would suddenly change sides
at the gulch when victory was still in the balance sometimes leaning this way and sometimes that he called out im redskin today what are you tootles
and tootles answered redskin what are you nibs
and nibs said redskin what are you
the extraordinary upshot of this adventure wasbut we have not decided yet that this is the adventure we are to narrate
perhaps a better one would be the night attack by the redskins on the house under the ground when several of them stuck in the hollow trees and had to be pulled out like corks
or we might tell how peter saved tiger lilys life in the mermaids lagoon and so made her his ally
peter gave orders that she was not to be disturbed
a shorter adventure and quite as exciting was tinker bells attempt with the help of some street fairies to have the sleeping wendy conveyed on a great floating leaf to the mainland
fortunately the leaf gave way and
wendy woke thinking it was bathtime and swam back
which of these adventures shall we choose
the best way will be to toss for it
i have tossed and the lagoon has won
this almost makes one wish that the gulch or the cake or tinks leaf had won
of course i could do it again and make it best out of three however perhaps fairest to stick to the lagoon
chapter viii
the mermaids lagoon
but just before they go on fire you see the lagoon
this is the nearest you ever get to it on the mainland just one heavenly moment if there could be two moments you might see the surf and hear the mermaids singing
the children often spent long summer days on this lagoon swimming or floating most of the time playing the mermaid games in the water and so forth
they treated all the boys in the same way except of course peter who chatted with them on marooners rock by the hour and sat on their tails when they got cheeky
he gave wendy one of their combs
peter would have accompanied her than because she had strict rules about every one being in bed by seven
she was often at the lagoon however on sunny days after rain when the mermaids come up in extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles
the bubbles of many colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls hitting them gaily from one to another with their tails and trying to keep them in the rainbow till they burst
the goals are at each end of the rainbow and the keepers only are allowed to use their hands
sometimes a dozen of these games will be going on in the lagoon at a time and it is quite a pretty sight
but the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by themselves for the mermaids immediately disappeared
this is the one mark that john has left on the neverland
it must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a rock for half an hour after their midday meal
wendy insisted on their doing this and it had to be a real rest even though the meal was makebelieve
so they lay there in the sun and their bodies glistened in it while she sat beside them and looked important
it was one such day and they were all on marooners rock
she was very busy stitching
while she stitched a change came to the lagoon
little shivers ran over it and the sun went away and shadows stole across the water turning it cold
wendy could no longer see to thread her needle and when she looked up the lagoon that had always hitherto been such a laughing place seemed formidable and unfriendly
it was not she knew that night had come but something as dark as night had come
no worse than that
it had not come but it had sent that shiver through the sea to say that it was coming
what was it
there crowded upon her all the stories she had been told of marooners
rock so called because evil captains put sailors on it and leave them there to drown
they drown when the tide rises for then it is submerged
of course she should have roused the children at once not merely because of the unknown that was stalking toward them but because it was no longer good for them to sleep on a rock grown chilly
but she was a young mother and she did not know this she thought you simply must stick to your rule about half an hour after the midday meal
so though fear was upon her and she longed to hear male voices she would not waken them
even when she heard the sound of muffled oars though her heart was in her mouth she did not waken them
she stood over them to let them have their sleep out
was it not brave of wendy
it was well for those boys then that there was one among them who could sniff danger even in his sleep
peter sprang erect as wide awake at once as a dog and with one warning cry he roused the others
he stood motionless one hand to his ear
the others came closer to him
a strange smile was playing about his face and wendy saw it and shuddered
while that smile was on his face no one dared address him all they could do was to stand ready to obey
the order came sharp and incisive
there was a gleam of legs and instantly the lagoon seemed deserted
marooners rock stood alone in the forbidding waters as if it were itself marooned
the boat drew nearer
it was the pirate dinghy with three figures in her smee and starkey and the third a captive no other than tiger
her hands and ankles were tied and she knew what was to be her fate
yet her face was impassive she was the daughter of a chief she must die as a chiefs daughter it is enough
they had caught her boarding the pirate ship with a knife in her mouth
no watch was kept on the ship it being hooks boast that the wind of his name guarded the ship for a mile around
now her fate would help to guard it also
one more wail would go the round in that wind by night
in the gloom that they brought with them the two pirates did not see the rock till they crashed into it
luff you lubber cried an irish voice that was smees heres the rock
now then what we have to do is to hoist the redskin on to it and leave her here to drown
it was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl on the rock she was too proud to offer a vain resistance
quite near the rock but out of sight two heads were bobbing up and down peters and wendys
wendy was crying for it was the first tragedy she had seen
peter had seen many tragedies but he had forgotten them all
he was less sorry than wendy for tiger lily it was two against one that angered him and he meant to save her
an easy way would have been to wait until the pirates had gone but he was never one to choose the easy way
there was almost nothing he could not do and he now imitated the voice of hook
ahoy there you lubbers
it was a marvellous imitation
the captain
said the pirates staring at each other in surprise
he must be swimming out to us starkey said when they had looked for him in vain
we are putting the redskin on the rock smee called out
set her free came the astonishing answer
yes cut her bonds and let her go
but captain at once dye hear cried peter or ill plunge my hook in you
this is queer
smee gasped
better do what the captain orders said starkey nervously
ay ay smee said and he cut tiger lilys cords
at once like an eel she slid between starkeys legs into the water
of course wendy was very elated over peters cleverness but she knew that he would be elated also and very likely crow and thus betray himself so at once her hand went out to cover his mouth
but it was stayed even in the act for boat ahoy
rang over the lagoon in hooks voice and this time it was not peter who had spoken
peter may have been about to crow but his face puckered in a whistle of surprise instead
again came the voice
now wendy understood
the real hook was also in the water
he was swimming to the boat and as his men showed a light to guide him he had soon reached them
he was tingling with life and also topheavy with conceit
am i not a wonder oh i am a wonder
he whispered to her and though she thought so also she was really glad for the sake of his reputation that no one heard him except herself
he signed to her to listen
the two pirates were very curious to know what had brought their captain to them but he sat with his head on his hook in a position of profound melancholy
captain is all well
they asked timidly but he answered with a hollow moan
he sighs said smee
he sighs again said starkey
and yet a third time he sighs said smee
then at last he spoke passionately
the games up he cried those boys have found a mother
affrighted though she was wendy swelled with pride
o evil day
cried starkey
whats a mother
asked the ignorant smee
wendy was so shocked that she exclaimed
he doesnt know
and always after this she felt that if you could have a pet pirate smee would be her one
peter pulled her beneath the water for hook had started up crying what was that
i heard nothing said starkey raising the lantern over the waters and as the pirates looked they saw a strange sight
it was the nest i have told you of floating on the lagoon and the never bird was sitting on it
see said hook in answer to smees question that is a mother
what a lesson
the nest must have fallen into the water but would the mother desert her eggs
there was a break in his voice as if for a moment he recalled innocent days whenbut he brushed away this weakness with his hook
smee much impressed gazed at the bird as the nest was borne past but the more suspicious starkey said if she is a mother perhaps she is hanging about here to help peter
hook winced
ay he said that is the fear that haunts me
he was roused from this dejection by smees eager voice
captain said smee could we not kidnap these boys mother and make her our mother
it is a princely scheme cried hook and at once it took practical shape in his great brain
we will seize the children and carry them to the boat the boys we will make walk the plank and wendy shall be our mother
again wendy forgot herself
she cried and bobbed
what was that
but they could see nothing
they thought it must have been a leaf in the wind
do you agree my bullies
asked hook
there is my hand on it they both said
and there is my hook
they all swore
by this time they were on the rock and suddenly hook remembered tiger lily
where is the redskin
he demanded abruptly
he had a playful humour at moments and they thought this was one of the moments
that is all right captain smee answered complacently we let her go
let her go
cried hook
twas your own orders the bosun faltered
you called over the water to us to let her go said starkey
brimstone and gall thundered hook what cozening is going on here
his face had gone black with rage but he saw that they believed their words and he was startled
lads he said shaking a little i gave no such order
it is passing queer smee said and they all fidgeted uncomfortably
hook raised his voice but there was a quiver in it
spirit that haunts this dark lagoon tonight he cried dost hear me
of course peter should have kept quiet but of course he did not
he immediately answered in hooks voice odds bobs hammer and tongs i hear you
in that supreme moment hook did not blanch even at the gills but smee and starkey clung to each other in terror
who are you stranger
hook demanded
i am james hook replied the voice captain of the jolly roger
you are not you are not hook cried hoarsely
brimstone and gall the voice retorted say that again and ill cast anchor in you
hook tried a more ingratiating manner
if you are hook he said almost humbly come tell me who am i
a codfish replied the voice only a codfish
hook echoed blankly and it was then but not till then that his proud spirit broke
he saw his men draw back from him
have we been captained all this time by a codfish
they muttered
it is lowering to our pride
they were his dogs snapping at him but tragic figure though he had become he scarcely heeded them
against such fearful evidence it was not their belief in him that he needed it was his own
he felt his ego slipping from him
dont desert me bully he whispered hoarsely to it
in his dark nature there was a touch of the feminine as in all the great pirates and it sometimes gave him intuitions
suddenly he tried the guessing game
hook he called have you another voice
now peter could never resist a game and he answered blithely in his own voice i have
and another name
asked hook
this answer rang out scornfully
ordinary boy
wonderful boy
to wendys pain the answer that rang out this time was yes
are you in england
are you here
hook was completely puzzled
you ask him some questions he said to the others wiping his damp brow
smee reflected
i cant think of a thing he said regretfully
cant guess cant guess
crowed peter
do you give it up
of course in his pride he was carrying the game too far and the miscreants saw their chance
yes yes they answered eagerly
well then he cried i am peter pan
in a moment hook was himself again and smee and starkey were his faithful henchmen
now we have him hook shouted
into the water smee
starkey mind the boat
take him dead or alive
he leaped as he spoke and simultaneously came the gay voice of peter
are you ready boys
ay ay from various parts of the lagoon
then lam into the pirates
the fight was short and sharp
first to draw blood was john who gallantly climbed into the boat and held starkey
there was fierce struggle in which the cutlass was torn from the pirates grasp
he wriggled overboard and john leapt after him
the dinghy drifted away
here and there a head bobbed up in the water and there was a flash of steel followed by a cry or a whoop
in the confusion some struck at their own side
the corkscrew of smee got tootles in the fourth rib but he was himself pinked in turn by curly
farther from the rock
starkey was pressing slightly and the twins hard
where all this time was peter
he was seeking bigger game
the others were all brave boys and they must not be blamed for backing from the pirate captain
his iron claw made a circle of dead water round him from which they fled like affrighted fishes
but there was one who did not fear him there was one prepared to enter that circle
strangely it was not in the water that they met
hook rose to the rock to breathe and at the same moment peter scaled it on the opposite side
the rock was slippery as a ball and they had to crawl rather than climb
neither knew that the other was coming
each feeling for a grip met the others arm in surprise they raised their heads their faces were almost touching so they met
some of the greatest heroes have confessed that just before they fell to they had a sinking
had it been so with peter at that moment i would admit it
after all he was the only man that the seacook had feared
but peter had no sinking he had one feeling only gladness and he gnashed his pretty teeth with joy
quick as thought he snatched a knife from hooks belt and was about to drive it home when he saw that he was higher up the rock than his foe
it would not have been fighting fair
he gave the pirate a hand to help him up
it was then that hook bit him
not the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed peter
it made him quite helpless
he could only stare horrified
every child is affected thus the first time he is treated unfairly
all he thinks he has a right to when he comes to you to be yours is fairness
after you have been unfair to him he will love you again but will never afterwards be quite the same boy
no one ever gets over the first unfairness no one except peter
he often met it but he always forgot it
i suppose that was the real difference between him and all the rest
so when he met it now it was like the first time and he could just stare helpless
twice the iron hand clawed him
a few moments afterwards the other boys saw hook in the water striking wildly for the ship no elation on the pestilent face now only white fear for the crocodile was in dogged pursuit of him
on ordinary occasions the boys would have swum alongside cheering but now they were uneasy for they had lost both peter and wendy and were scouring the lagoon for them calling them by name
they found the dinghy and went home in it shouting peter wendy as they went but no answer came save mocking laughter from the mermaids
they must be swimming back or flying the boys concluded
they were not very anxious because they had such faith in peter
they chuckled boylike because they would be late for bed and it was all mother wendys fault
when their voices died away there came cold silence over the lagoon and then a feeble cry
two small figures were beating against the rock the girl had fainted and lay on the boys arm
with a last effort peter pulled her up the rock and then lay down beside her
even as he also fainted he saw that the water was rising
he knew that they would soon be drowned but he could do no more
as they lay side by side a mermaid caught wendy by the feet and began pulling her softly into the water
peter feeling her slip from him woke with a start and was just in time to draw her back
but he had to tell her the truth
we are on the rock wendy he said but it is growing smaller
soon the water will be over it
she did not understand even now
we must go she said almost brightly
yes he answered faintly
shall we swim or fly peter
he had to tell her
do you think you could swim or fly as far as the island wendy without my help
she had to admit that she was too tired
what is it
she asked anxious about him at once
i cant help you wendy
hook wounded me
i can neither fly nor swim
do you mean we shall both be drowned
look how the water is rising
they put their hands over their eyes to shut out the sight
they thought they would soon be no more
as they sat thus something brushed against peter as light as a kiss and stayed there as if saying timidly can i be of any use
it was the tail of a kite which michael had made some days before
it had torn itself out of his hand and floated away
michaels kite peter said without interest but next moment he had seized the tail and was pulling the kite toward him
it lifted michael off the ground he cried why should it not carry you
both of us
it cant lift two michael and curly tried
let us draw lots wendy said bravely
and you a lady never
already he had tied the tail round her
she clung to him she refused to go without him but with a goodbye
wendy he pushed her from the rock and in a few minutes she was borne out of his sight
peter was alone on the lagoon
the rock was very small now soon it would be submerged
pale rays of light tiptoed across the waters and by and by there was to be heard a sound at once the most musical and the most melancholy in the world the mermaids calling to the moon
peter was not quite like other boys but he was afraid at last
a tremour ran through him like a shudder passing over the sea but on the sea one shudder follows another till there are hundreds of them and peter felt just the one
next moment he was standing erect on the rock again with that smile on his face and a drum beating within him
it was saying to die will be an awfully big adventure
chapter ix
the never bird
the last sound peter heard before he was quite alone were the mermaids retiring one by one to their bedchambers under the sea
steadily the waters rose till they were nibbling at his feet and to pass the time until they made their final gulp he watched the only thing on the lagoon
he thought it was a piece of floating paper perhaps part of the kite and wondered idly how long it would take to drift ashore
it was not really a piece of paper it was the never bird making desperate efforts to reach peter on the nest
by working her wings in a way she had learned since the nest fell into the water she was able to some extent to guide her strange craft but by the time peter recognised her she was very exhausted
she had come to save him to give him her nest though there were eggs in it
i rather wonder at the bird for though he had been nice to her he had also sometimes tormented her
i can suppose only that like mrs
darling and the rest of them she was melted because he had all his first teeth
she called out to him what she had come for and he called out to her what she was doing there but of course neither of them understood the others language
well not only could they not understand each other but they forgot their manners
iwantyoutogetintothenest the bird called speaking as slowly and distinctly as possible andthenyoucandriftashore butiamtootiredtobringitanynearersoyoumusttry toswimtoit
what are you quacking about
peter answered
why dont you let the nest drift as usual
iwantyou the bird said and repeated it all over
then peter tried slow and distinct
whatareyouquackingabout
the never bird became irritated they have very short tempers
you dunderheaded little jay
she screamed why dont you do as i tell you
peter felt that she was calling him names and at a venture he retorted hotly so are you
then rather curiously they both snapped out the same remark shut up
nevertheless the bird was determined to save him if she could and by one last mighty effort she propelled the nest against the rock
then up she flew deserting her eggs so as to make her meaning clear
then at last he understood and clutched the nest and waved his thanks to the bird as she fluttered overhead
it was not to receive his thanks however that she hung there in the sky it was not even to watch him get into the nest it was to see what he did with her eggs
there were two large white eggs and peter lifted them up and reflected
the bird covered her face with her wings so as not to see the last of them but she could not help peeping between the feathers
i forget whether i have told you that there was a stave on the rock driven into it by some buccaneers of long ago to mark the site of buried treasure
the stave was still there and on it starkey had hung his hat a deep tarpaulin watertight with a broad brim
peter put the eggs into this hat and set it on the lagoon
it floated beautifully
the never bird saw at once what he was up to and screamed her admiration of him and alas peter crowed his agreement with her
then he got into the nest reared the stave in it as a mast and hung up his shirt for a sail
at the same moment the bird fluttered down upon the hat and once more sat snugly on her eggs
she drifted in one direction and he was borne off in another both cheering
of course when peter landed he beached his barque in a place where the bird would easily find it but the hat was such a great success that she abandoned the nest
it drifted about till it went to pieces and often starkey came to the shore of the lagoon and with many bitter feelings watched the bird sitting on his hat
as we shall not see her again it may be worth mentioning here that all never birds now build in that shape of nest with a broad brim on which the youngsters take an airing
great were the rejoicings when peter reached the home under the ground almost as soon as wendy who had been carried hither and thither by the kite
every boy had adventures to tell but perhaps the biggest adventure of all was that they were several hours late for bed
next day however she was awfully tender and gave out bandages to every one and they played till bedtime at limping about and carrying their arms in slings
the happy home
one important result of the brush on the lagoon was that it made the redskins their friends
peter had saved tiger lily from a dreadful fate and now there was nothing she and her braves would not do for him
all night they sat above keeping watch over the home under the ground and awaiting the big attack by the pirates which obviously could not be much longer delayed
even by day they hung about smoking the pipe of peace and looking almost as if they wanted titbits to eat
they called peter the great white father prostrating themselves before him and he liked this tremendously so that it was not really good for him
the great white father he would say to them in a very lordly manner as they grovelled at his feet is glad to see the piccaninny warriors protecting his wigwam from the pirates
me tiger lily that lovely creature would reply
peter pan save me me his velly nice friend
me no let pirates hurt him
she was far too pretty to cringe in this way but peter thought it his due and he would answer condescendingly it is good
peter pan has spoken
they said howdo
to them and things like that and what annoyed the boys was that peter seemed to think this all right
secretly wendy sympathised with them a little but she was far too loyal a housewife to listen to any complaints against father
father knows best she always said whatever her private opinion must be
her private opinion was that the redskins should not call her a squaw
we have now reached the evening that was to be known among them as the
night of nights because of its adventures and their upshot
the way you got the time on the island was to find the crocodile and then stay near him till the clock struck
the meal happened to be a makebelieve tea and they sat around the board guzzling in their greed and really what with their chatter and recriminations the noise as wendy said was positively deafening
to be sure she did not mind noise but she simply would not have them grabbing things and then excusing themselves by saying that tootles had pushed their elbow
silence cried wendy when for the twentieth time she had told them that they were not all to speak at once
is your mug empty slightly darling
not quite empty mummy slightly said after looking into an imaginary mug
he hasnt even begun to drink his milk nibs interposed
this was telling and slightly seized his chance
i complain of nibs he cried promptly
john however had held up his hand first
may i sit in peters chair as he is not here
sit in fathers chair john
wendy was scandalised
certainly not
he is not really our father john answered
he didnt even know how a father does till i showed him
this was grumbling
we complain of john cried the twins
tootles held up his hand
he was so much the humblest of them indeed he was the only humble one that wendy was specially gentle with him
i dont suppose tootles said diffidently that i could be father
no tootles
once tootles began which was not very often he had a silly way of going on
as i cant be father he said heavily i dont suppose michael you would let me be baby
no i wont michael rapped out
he was already in his basket
as i cant be baby tootles said getting heavier and heavier and heavier do you think i could be a twin
no indeed replied the twins its awfully difficult to be a twin
as i cant be anything important said tootles would any of you like to see me do a trick
no they all replied
then at last he stopped
i hadnt really any hope he said
the hateful telling broke out again
slightly is coughing on the table
the twins began with cheesecakes
curly is taking both butter and honey
nibs is speaking with his mouth full
i complain of the twins
i complain of curly
i complain of nibs
oh dear oh dear cried wendy im sure i sometimes think that spinsters are to be envied
she told them to clear away and sat down to her workbasket a heavy load of stockings and every knee with a hole in it as usual
wendy remonstrated michael im too big for a cradle
i must have somebody in a cradle she said almost tartly and you are the littlest
a cradle is such a nice homely thing to have about a house
while she sewed they played around her such a group of happy faces and dancing limbs lit up by that romantic fire
it had become a very familiar scene this in the home under the ground but we are looking on it for the last time
there was a step above and wendy you may be sure was the first to recognize it
children i hear your fathers step
he likes you to meet him at the door
above the redskins crouched before peter
watch well braves
i have spoken
and then as so often before the gay children dragged him from his tree
as so often before but never again
he had brought nuts for the boys as well as the correct time for wendy
peter you just spoil them you know wendy simpered
ah old lady said peter hanging up his gun
it was me told him mothers are called old lady michael whispered to
i complain of michael said curly instantly
the first twin came to peter
father we want to dance
dance away my little man said peter who was in high good humour
but we want you to dance
peter was really the best dancer among them but he pretended to be scandalised
my old bones would rattle
and mummy too
what cried wendy the mother of such an armful dance
but on a saturday night slightly insinuated
of course it is saturday night peter wendy said relenting
people of our figure wendy
but it is only among our own progeny
so they were told they could dance but they must put on their nighties first
it is sweet peter isnt it
wendy said frightfully gratified
peter i think curly has your nose
michael takes after you
she went to him and put her hand on his shoulder
dear peter she said with such a large family of course i have now passed my best but you dont want to change me do you
certainly he did not want a change but he looked at her uncomfortably blinking you know like one not sure whether he was awake or asleep
peter what is it
i was just thinking he said a little scared
it is only makebelieve isnt it that i am their father
oh yes wendy said primly
you see he continued apologetically it would make me seem so old to be their real father
but they are ours peter yours and mine
but not really wendy
he asked anxiously
not if you dont wish it she replied and she distinctly heard his sigh of relief
peter she asked trying to speak firmly what are your exact feelings to me
those of a devoted son wendy
i thought so she said and went and sat by herself at the extreme end of the room
you are so queer he said frankly puzzled and tiger lily is just the same
there is something she wants to be to me but she says it is not my mother
no indeed it is not wendy replied with frightful emphasis
now we know why she was prejudiced against the redskins
then what is it
it isnt for a lady to tell
oh very well peter said a little nettled
perhaps tinker bell will tell me
oh yes tinker bell will tell you wendy retorted scornfully
she is an abandoned little creature
here tink who was in her bedroom eavesdropping squeaked out something impudent
she says she glories in being abandoned peter interpreted
he had a sudden idea
perhaps tink wants to be my mother
you silly ass
cried tinker bell in a passion
she had said it so often that wendy needed no translation
i almost agree with her wendy snapped
fancy wendy snapping
but she had been much tried and she little knew what was to happen before the night was out
if she had known she would not have snapped
none of them knew
perhaps it was best not to know
their ignorance gave them one more glad hour and as it was to be their last hour on the island let us rejoice that there were sixty glad minutes in it
they sang and danced in their nightgowns
so uproariously gay was the dance and how they buffeted each other on the bed and out of it
it was a pillow fight rather than a dance and when it was finished the pillows insisted on one bout more like partners who know that they may never meet again
the stories they told before it was time for wendys goodnight story
even slightly tried to tell a story that night but the beginning was so fearfully dull that it appalled not only the others but himself and he said gloomily yes it is a dull beginning
i say let us pretend that it is the end
and then at last they all got into bed for wendys story the story they loved best the story peter hated
usually when she began to tell this story he left the room or put his hands over his ears and possibly if he had done either of those things this time they might all still be on the island
but tonight he remained on his stool and we shall see what happened
chapter xi
wendys story listen then said wendy settling down to her story with michael at her feet and seven boys in the bed
there was once a gentleman i had rather he had been a lady curly said
i wish he had been a white rat said nibs
quiet their mother admonished them
there was a lady also and oh mummy cried the first twin you mean that there is a lady also dont you
she is not dead is she
i am awfully glad she isnt dead said tootles
are you glad john
of course i am
are you glad nibs
are you glad twins
we are glad
oh dear sighed wendy
little less noise there peter called out determined that she should have fair play however beastly a story it might be in his opinion
the gentlemans name wendy continued was mr
darling and her name was mrs
i knew them john said to annoy the others
i think i knew them said michael rather doubtfully
they were married you know explained wendy and what do you think they had
white rats cried nibs inspired
its awfully puzzling said tootles who knew the story by heart
quiet tootles
they had three descendants
what is descendants
well you are one twin
did you hear that john
i am a descendant
descendants are only children said john
oh dear oh dear sighed wendy
now these three children had a faithful nurse called nana but mr
darling was angry with her and chained her up in the yard and so all the children flew away
its an awfully good story said nibs
they flew away wendy continued to the neverland where the lost children are
i just thought they did curly broke in excitedly
i dont know how it is but i just thought they did
o wendy cried tootles was one of the lost children called
yes he was
i am in a story
hurrah i am in a story nibs
now i want you to consider the feelings of the unhappy parents with all their children flown away
they all moaned though they were not really considering the feelings of the unhappy parents one jot
think of the empty beds
its awfully sad the first twin said cheerfully
i dont see how it can have a happy ending said the second twin
do you nibs
im frightfully anxious
if you knew how great is a mothers love wendy told them triumphantly you would have no fear
she had now come to the part that peter hated
i do like a mothers love said tootles hitting nibs with a pillow
do you like a mothers love nibs
i do just said nibs hitting back
you see wendy said complacently our heroine knew that the mother would always leave the window open for her children to fly back by so they stayed away for years and had a lovely time
did they ever go back
let us now said wendy bracing herself up for her finest effort take a peep into the future and they all gave themselves the twist that makes peeps into the future easier
years have rolled by and who is this elegant lady of uncertain age alighting at london station
o wendy who is she
cried nibs every bit as excited as if he didnt know
can it beyesnoit isthe fair wendy
and who are the two noble portly figures accompanying her now grown to mans estate
can they be john and michael
see dear brothers says wendy pointing upwards there is the window still standing open
ah now we are rewarded for our sublime faith in a mothers love
so up they flew to their mummy and daddy and pen cannot describe the happy scene over which we draw a veil
that was the story and they were as pleased with it as the fair narrator herself
everything just as it should be you see
so great indeed was their faith in a mothers love that they felt they could afford to be callous for a bit longer
but there was one there who knew better and when wendy finished he uttered a hollow groan
what is it peter
she cried running to him thinking he was ill
she felt him solicitously lower down than his chest
where is it
it isnt that kind of pain peter replied darkly
then what kind is it
wendy you are wrong about mothers
they all gathered round him in affright so alarming was his agitation and with a fine candour he told them what he had hitherto concealed
i am not sure that this was true but peter thought it was true and it scared them
are you sure mothers are like that
so this was the truth about mothers
still it is best to be careful and no one knows so quickly as a child when he should give in
wendy let us go home cried john and michael together
yes she said clutching them
not tonight
asked the lost boys bewildered
they knew in what they called their hearts that one can get on quite well without a mother and that it is only the mothers who think you cant
at once wendy replied resolutely for the horrible thought had come to her perhaps mother is in half mourning by this time
this dread made her forgetful of what must be peters feelings and she said to him rather sharply peter will you make the necessary arrangements
if you wish it he replied as coolly as if she had asked him to pass the nuts
not so much as a sorrytoloseyou between them
if she did not mind the parting he was going to show her was peter that neither did he
he did this because there is a saying in the neverland that every time you breathe a grownup dies and peter was killing them off vindictively as fast as possible
then having given the necessary instructions to the redskins he returned to the home where an unworthy scene had been enacted in his absence
panicstricken at the thought of losing wendy the lost boys had advanced upon her threateningly
it will be worse than before she came they cried
we shant let her go
lets keep her prisoner
ay chain her up
in her extremity an instinct told her to which of them to turn
tootles she cried i appeal to you
was it not strange
she appealed to tootles quite the silliest one
grandly however did tootles respond
for that one moment he dropped his silliness and spoke with dignity
i am just tootles he said and nobody minds me
but the first who does not behave to wendy like an english gentleman i will blood him severely
he drew back his hanger and for that instant his sun was at noon
the others held back uneasily
then peter returned and they saw at once that they would get no support from him
he would keep no girl in the
neverland against her will
wendy he said striding up and down i have asked the redskins to guide you through the wood as flying tires you so
thank you peter
then he continued in the short sharp voice of one accustomed to be obeyed tinker bell will take you across the sea
wake her nibs
nibs had to knock twice before he got an answer though tink had really been sitting up in bed listening for some time
who are you
how dare you
go away she cried
you are to get up tink nibs called and take wendy on a journey
of course tink had been delighted to hear that wendy was going but she was jolly well determined not to be her courier and she said so in still more offensive language
then she pretended to be asleep again
she says she wont
nibs exclaimed aghast at such insubordination whereupon peter went sternly toward the young ladys chamber
tink he rapped out if you dont get up and dress at once i will open the curtains and then we shall all see you in your neglige
this made her leap to the floor
who said i wasnt getting up
in the meantime the boys were gazing very forlornly at wendy now equipped with john and michael for the journey
by this time they were dejected not merely because they were about to lose her but also because they felt that she was going off to something nice to which they had not been invited
novelty was beckoning to them as usual
crediting them with a nobler feeling wendy melted
dear ones she said if you will all come with me i feel almost sure
i can get my father and mother to adopt you
the invitation was meant specially for peter but each of the boys was thinking exclusively of himself and at once they jumped with joy
but wont they think us rather a handful
nibs asked in the middle of his jump
oh no said wendy rapidly thinking it out it will only mean having a few beds in the drawingroom they can be hidden behind the screens on first thursdays
peter can we go
they all cried imploringly
they took it for granted that if they went he would go also but really they scarcely cared
thus children are ever ready when novelty knocks to desert their dearest ones
all right peter replied with a bitter smile and immediately they rushed to get their things
and now peter wendy said thinking she had put everything right i am going to give you your medicine before you go
she loved to give them medicine and undoubtedly gave them too much
of course it was only water but it was out of a bottle and she always shook the bottle and counted the drops which gave it a certain medicinal quality
on this occasion however she did not give peter his draught for just as she had prepared it she saw a look on his face that made her heart sink
get your things peter she cried shaking
no he answered pretending indifference i am not going with you
to show that her departure would leave him unmoved he skipped up and down the room playing gaily on his heartless pipes
she had to run about after him though it was rather undignified
to find your mother she coaxed
now if peter had ever quite had a mother he no longer missed her
he could do very well without one
he had thought them out and remembered only their bad points
no no he told wendy decisively perhaps she would say i was old and i just want always to be a little boy and to have fun
but peter no
and so the others had to be told
peter isnt coming
peter not coming
they gazed blankly at him their sticks over their backs and on each stick a bundle
their first thought was that if
peter was not going he had probably changed his mind about letting them go
but he was far too proud for that
if you find your mothers he said darkly i hope you will like them
the awful cynicism of this made an uncomfortable impression and most of them began to look rather doubtful
after all their faces said were they not noodles to want to go
now then cried peter no fuss no blubbering goodbye wendy and he held out his hand cheerily quite as if they must really go now for he had something important to do
she had to take his hand and there was no indication that he would prefer a thimble
you will remember about changing your flannels peter
she said lingering over him
she was always so particular about their flannels
and you will take your medicine
that seemed to be everything and an awkward pause followed
peter however was not the kind that breaks down before other people
are you ready tinker bell
he called out
then lead the way
tink darted up the nearest tree but no one followed her for it was at this moment that the pirates made their dreadful attack upon the redskins
above where all had been so still the air was rent with shrieks and the clash of steel
below there was dead silence
mouths opened and remained open
wendy fell on her knees but her arms were extended toward peter
all arms were extended to him as if suddenly blown in his direction they were beseeching him mutely not to desert them
as for peter he seized his sword the same he thought he had slain barbecue with and the lust of battle was in his eye
chapter xii
the children are carried off
the pirate attack had been a complete surprise a sure proof that the unscrupulous hook had conducted it improperly for to surprise redskins fairly is beyond the wit of the white man
the white men have in the meantime made a rude stockade on the summit of yonder undulating ground at the foot of which a stream runs for it is destruction to be too far from water
there they await the onslaught the inexperienced ones clutching their revolvers and treading on twigs but the old hands sleeping tranquilly until just before the dawn
through the long black night the savage scouts wriggle snakelike among the grass without stirring a blade
the brushwood closes behind them as silently as sand into which a mole has dived
not a sound is to be heard save when they give vent to a wonderful imitation of the lonely call of the coyote
the cry is answered by other braves and some of them do it even better than the coyotes who are not very good at it
that this was the usual procedure was so well known to hook that in disregarding it he cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance
the piccaninnies on their part trusted implicitly to his honour and their whole action of the night stands out in marked contrast to his
they left nothing undone that was consistent with the reputation of their tribe
every foot of ground between the spot where hook had landed his forces and the home under the trees was stealthily examined by braves wearing their mocassins with the heels in front
they found only one hillock with a stream at its base so that hook had no choice here he must establish himself and wait for just before the dawn
here dreaming though wideawake of the exquisite tortures to which they were to put him at break of day those confiding savages were found by the treacherous hook
around the brave tiger lily were a dozen of her stoutest warriors and they suddenly saw the perfidious pirates bearing down upon them
fell from their eyes then the film through which they had looked at victory
no more would they torture at the stake
for them the happy huntinggrounds was now
they knew it but as their fathers sons they acquitted themselves
even then they had time to gather in a phalanx that would have been hard to break had they risen quickly but this they were forbidden to do by the traditions of their race
it is written that the noble savage must never express surprise in the presence of the white
thus terrible as the sudden appearance of the pirates must have been to them they remained stationary for a moment not a muscle moving as if the foe had come by invitation
then indeed the tradition gallantly upheld they seized their weapons and the air was torn with the warcry but it was now too late
it is no part of ours to describe what was a massacre rather than a fight
thus perished many of the flower of the piccaninny tribe
not all unavenged did they die for with lean wolf fell alf mason to disturb the spanish main no more and among others who bit the dust were geo
scourie chas
turley and the alsatian foggerty
turley fell to the tomahawk of the terrible panther who ultimately cut a way through the pirates with tiger lily and a small remnant of the tribe
to what extent hook is to blame for his tactics on this occasion is for the historian to decide
had he waited on the rising ground till the proper hour he and his men would probably have been butchered and in judging him it is only fair to take this into account
what he should perhaps have done was to acquaint his opponents that he proposed to follow a new method
on the other hand this as destroying the element of surprise would have made his strategy of no avail so that the whole question is beset with difficulties
one cannot at least withhold a reluctant admiration for the wit that had conceived so bold a scheme and the fell genius with which it was carried out
what were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant moment
fain would his dogs have known as breathing heavily and wiping their cutlasses they gathered at a discreet distance from his hook and squinted through their ferret eyes at this extraordinary man
elation must have been in his heart but his face did not reflect it ever a dark and solitary enigma he stood aloof from his followers in spirit as in substance
the nights work was not yet over for it was not the redskins he had come out to destroy they were but the bees to be smoked so that he should get at the honey
it was pan he wanted pan and wendy and their band but chiefly pan
peter was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the mans hatred of him
the truth is that there was a something about
peter which goaded the pirate captain to frenzy
it was not his courage it was not his engaging appearance it was not
there is no beating about the bush for we know quite well what it was and have got to tell
it was peters cockiness
this had got on hooks nerves it made his iron claw twitch and at night it disturbed him like an insect
while peter lived the tortured man felt that he was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come
the question now was how to get down the trees or how to get his dogs down
he ran his greedy eyes over them searching for the thinnest ones
they wriggled uncomfortably for they knew he would not scruple to ram them down with poles
in the meantime what of the boys
the pandemonium above has ceased almost as suddenly as it arose passed like a fierce gust of wind but they know that in the passing it has determined their fate
which side had won
the pirates listening avidly at the mouths of the trees heard the question put by every boy and alas they also heard peters answer
if the redskins have won he said they will beat the tomtom it is always their sign of victory
now smee had found the tomtom and was at that moment sitting on it
you will never hear the tomtom again he muttered but inaudibly of course for strict silence had been enjoined
to his amazement hook signed him to beat the tomtom and slowly there came to smee an understanding of the dreadful wickedness of the order
never probably had this simple man admired hook so much
twice smee beat upon the instrument and then stopped to listen gleefully
the tomtom the miscreants heard peter cry an indian victory
the doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black hearts above and almost immediately they repeated their goodbyes to
this puzzled the pirates but all their other feelings were swallowed by a base delight that the enemy were about to come up the trees
they smirked at each other and rubbed their hands
rapidly and silently hook gave his orders one man to each tree and the others to arrange themselves in a line two yards apart
chapter xiii
do you believe in fairies
the more quickly this horror is disposed of the better
the first to emerge from his tree was curly
he rose out of it into the arms of
cecco who flung him to smee who flung him to starkey who flung him to bill jukes who flung him to noodler and so he was tossed from one to another till he fell at the feet of the black pirate
all the boys were plucked from their trees in this ruthless manner and several of them were in the air at a time like bales of goods flung from hand to hand
a different treatment was accorded to wendy who came last
with ironical politeness hook raised his hat to her and offering her his arm escorted her to the spot where the others were being gagged
he did it with such an air he was so frightfully distingu that she was too fascinated to cry out
she was only a little girl
perhaps it is telltale to divulge that for a moment hook entranced her and we tell on her only because her slip led to strange results
slightlys secret and without the secret he could not presently have made his foul attempt on peters life
they were tied to prevent their flying away doubled up with their knees close to their ears and for the trussing of them the black pirate had cut a rope into nine equal pieces
all went well until
slightlys turn came when he was found to be like those irritating parcels that use up all the string in going round and leave no tags with which to tie a knot
the pirates kicked him in their rage just as you kick the parcel though in fairness you should kick the string and strange to say it was hook who told them to belay their violence
his lip was curled with malicious triumph
slightly white to the gills knew that hook had surprised his secret which was this that no boy so blown out could use a tree wherein an average man need stick
poor slightly most wretched of all the children now for he was in a panic about peter bitterly regretted what he had done
how to convey them
hunched up in their ropes they might indeed be rolled down hill like barrels but most of the way lay through a morass
again hooks genius surmounted difficulties
he indicated that the little house must be used as a conveyance
the children were flung into it four stout pirates raised it on their shoulders the others fell in behind and singing the hateful pirate chorus the strange procession set off through the wood
hook saw it and it did peter a bad service
it dried up any trickle of pity for him that may have remained in the pirates infuriated breast
the first thing he did on finding himself alone in the fast falling night was to tiptoe to slightlys tree and make sure that it provided him with a passage
then for long he remained brooding his hat of ill omen on the sward so that any gentle breeze which had arisen might play refreshingly through his hair
dark as were his thoughts his blue eyes were as soft as the periwinkle
intently he listened for any sound from the nether world but all was as silent below as above the house under the ground seemed to be but one more empty tenement in the void
was that boy asleep or did he stand waiting at the foot of slightlys tree with his dagger in his hand
there was no way of knowing save by going down
hook let his cloak slip softly to the ground and then biting his lips till a lewd blood stood on them he stepped into the tree
he was a brave man but for a moment he had to stop there and wipe his brow which was dripping like a candle
then silently he let himself go into the unknown
he arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft and stood still again biting at his breath which had almost left him
on the bed lay peter fast asleep
then he decided not to take his medicine so as to grieve wendy
then he lay down on the bed outside the coverlet to vex her still more for she had always tucked them inside it because you never know that you may not grow chilly at the turn of the night
then he nearly cried but it struck him how indignant she would be if he laughed instead so he laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the middle of it
sometimes though not often he had dreams and they were more painful than the dreams of other boys
for hours he could not be separated from these dreams though he wailed piteously in them
they had to do i think with the riddle of his existence
at such times it had been
but on this occasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep
one arm dropped over the edge of the bed one leg was arched and the unfinished part of his laugh was stranded on his mouth which was open showing the little pearls
thus defenceless hook found him
he stood silent at the foot of the tree looking across the chamber at his enemy
did no feeling of compassion disturb his sombre breast
mastered by his better self he would have returned reluctantly up the tree but for one thing
what stayed him was peters impertinent appearance as he slept
the open mouth the drooping arm the arched knee they were such a personification of cockiness as taken together will never again one may hope be presented to eyes so sensitive to their offensiveness
they steeled hooks heart
if his rage had broken him into a hundred pieces every one of them would have disregarded the incident and leapt at the sleeper
though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed hook stood in darkness himself and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered an obstacle the door of slightlys tree
it did not entirely fill the aperture and he had been looking over it
feeling for the catch he found to his fury that it was low down beyond his reach
to his disordered brain it seemed then that the irritating quality in peters face and figure visibly increased and he rattled the door and flung himself against it
was his enemy to escape him after all
but what was that
the red in his eye had caught sight of peters medicine standing on a ledge within easy reach
he fathomed what it was straightaway and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power
lest he should be taken alive hook always carried about his person a dreadful drug blended by himself of all the deathdealing rings that had come into his possession
these he had boiled down into a yellow liquid quite unknown to science which was probably the most virulent poison in existence
five drops of this he now added to peters cup
his hand shook but it was in exultation rather than in shame
as he did it he avoided glancing at the sleeper but not lest pity should unnerve him merely to avoid spilling
then one long gloating look he cast upon his victim and turning wormed his way with difficulty up the tree
as he emerged at the top he looked the very spirit of evil breaking from its hole
peter slept on
the light guttered and went out leaving the tenement in darkness but still he slept
it must have been not less than ten oclock by the crocodile when he suddenly sat up in his bed wakened by he knew not what
it was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his tree
soft and cautious but in that stillness it was sinister
peter felt for his dagger till his hand gripped it
then he spoke
who is that
for long there was no answer then again the knock
who are you
he was thrilled and he loved being thrilled
in two strides he reached the door
unlike slightlys door it filled the aperture so that he could not see beyond it nor could the one knocking see him
i wont open unless you speak peter cried
then at last the visitor spoke in a lovely belllike voice
let me in peter
it was tink and quickly he unbarred to her
she flew in excitedly her face flushed and her dress stained with mud
what is it
oh you could never guess
she cried and offered him three guesses
out with it
he shouted and in one ungrammatical sentence as long as the ribbons that conjurers pull from their mouths she told of the capture of wendy and the boys
peters heart bobbed up and down as he listened
wendy bound and on the pirate ship she who loved everything to be just so
ill rescue her
he cried leaping at his weapons
as he leapt he thought of something he could do to please her
he could take his medicine
his hand closed on the fatal draught
shrieked tinker bell who had heard hook mutter about his deed as he sped through the forest
it is poisoned
who could have poisoned it
dont be silly
how could hook have got down here
alas tinker bell could not explain this for even she did not know the dark secret of slightlys tree
nevertheless hooks words had left no room for doubt
the cup was poisoned
besides said peter quite believing himself i never fell asleep
he raised the cup
no time for words now time for deeds and with one of her lightning movements tink got between his lips and the draught and drained it to the dregs
why tink how dare you drink my medicine
but she did not answer
already she was reeling in the air
what is the matter with you
cried peter suddenly afraid
it was poisoned peter she told him softly and now i am going to be dead
o tink did you drink it to save me
but why tink
her wings would scarcely carry her now but in reply she alighted on his shoulder and gave his nose a loving bite
she whispered in his ear you silly ass and then tottering to her chamber lay down on the bed
his head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt near her in distress
every moment her light was growing fainter and he knew that if it went out she would be no more
she liked his tears so much that she put out her beautiful finger and let them run over it
her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said
then he made it out
she was saying that she thought she could get well again if children believed in fairies
peter flung out his arms
there were no children there and it was night time but he addressed all who might be dreaming of the
neverland and who were therefore nearer to him than you think boys and girls in their nighties and naked papooses in their baskets hung from trees
do you believe
tink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate
she fancied she heard answers in the affirmative and then again she wasnt sure
what do you think
she asked peter
if you believe he shouted to them clap your hands dont let tink die
many clapped
some didnt
a few beasts hissed
the clapping stopped suddenly as if countless mothers had rushed to their nurseries to see what on earth was happening but already tink was saved
first her voice grew strong then she popped out of bed then she was flashing through the room more merry and impudent than ever
she never thought of thanking those who believed but she would have liked to get at the ones who had hissed
and now to rescue wendy
the moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when peter rose from his tree begirt with weapons and wearing little else to set out upon his perilous quest
it was not such a night as he would have chosen
he regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange names that they are very wild and difficult of approach
there was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion at which happily he was an adept
but in what direction for he could not be sure that the children had been taken to the ship
a light fall of snow had obliterated all footmarks and a deathly silence pervaded the island as if for a space nature stood still in horror of the recent carnage
he had taught the children something of the forest lore that he had himself learned from tiger lily and tinker bell and knew that in their dire hour they were not likely to forget it
slightly if he had an opportunity would blaze the trees for instance curly would drop seeds and wendy would leave her handkerchief at some important place
the morning was needed to search for such guidance and he could not wait
the upper world had called him but would give no help
the crocodile passed him but not another living thing not a sound not a movement and yet he knew well that sudden death might be at the next tree or stalking him from behind
he swore this terrible oath hook or me this time
now he crawled forward like a snake and again erect he darted across a space on which the moonlight played one finger on his lip and his dagger at the ready
he was frightfully happy
chapter xiv
the pirate ship
she was the cannibal of the seas and scarce needed that watchful eye for she floated immune in the horror of her name
she was wrapped in the blanket of night through which no sound from her could have reached the shore
there was little sound and none agreeable save the whir of the ships sewing machine at which smee sat ever industrious and obliging the essence of the commonplace pathetic
of this as of almost everything else smee was quite unconscious
hook trod the deck in thought
o man unfathomable
it was his hour of triumph
peter had been removed for ever from his path and all the other boys were in the brig about to walk the plank
but there was no elation in his gait which kept pace with the action of his sombre mind
hook was profoundly dejected
he was often thus when communing with himself on board ship in the quietude of the night
it was because he was so terribly alone
this inscrutable man never felt more alone than when surrounded by his dogs
they were socially inferior to him
hook was not his true name
thus it was offensive to him even now to board a ship in the same dress in which he grappled her and he still adhered in his walk to the schools distinguished slouch
but above all he retained the passion for good form
however much he may have degenerated he still knew that this is all that really matters
from far within him he heard a creaking as of rusty portals and through them came a stern taptaptap like hammering in the night when one cannot sleep
have you been good form today
was their eternal question
fame fame that glittering bauble it is mine he cried
is it quite good form to be distinguished at anything
the taptap from his school replied
i am the only man whom barbecue feared he urged and flint feared
barbecue flintwhat house
came the cutting retort
most disquieting reflection of all was it not bad form to think about good form
his vitals were tortured by this problem
it was a claw within him sharper than the iron one and as it tore him the perspiration dripped down his tallow countenance and streaked his doublet
ofttimes he drew his sleeve across his face but there was no damming that trickle
ah envy not hook
there came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution
it was as if
peters terrible oath had boarded the ship
hook felt a gloomy desire to make his dying speech lest presently there should be no time for it
better for hook he cried if he had had less ambition
it was in his darkest hours only that he referred to himself in the third person
no little children to love me
strange that he should think of this which had never troubled him before perhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind
for long he muttered to himself staring at smee who was hemming placidly under the conviction that all children feared him
feared him
feared smee
there was not a child on board the brig that night who did not already love him
he had said horrid things to them and hit them with the palm of his hand because he could not hit with his fist but they had only clung to him the more
michael had tried on his spectacles
to tell poor smee that they thought him lovable
hook itched to do it but it seemed too brutal
instead he revolved this mystery in his mind why do they find smee lovable
he pursued the problem like the sleuthhound that he was
if smee was lovable what was it that made him so
a terrible answer suddenly presented itselfgood form
had the bosun good form without knowing it which is the best form of all
he remembered that you have to prove you dont know you have it before you are eligible for pop
with a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over smees head but he did not tear
what arrested him was this reflection to claw a man because he is good form what would that be
the unhappy hook was as impotent as he was damp and he fell forward like a cut flower
quiet you scugs he cried or ill cast anchor in you and at once the din was hushed
are all the children chained so that they cannot fly away
then hoist them up
the wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold all except wendy and ranged in line in front of him
for a time he seemed unconscious of their presence
he lolled at his ease humming not unmelodiously snatches of a rude song and fingering a pack of cards
ever and anon the light from his cigar gave a touch of colour to his face
now then bullies he said briskly six of you walk the plank tonight but i have room for two cabin boys
which of you is it to be
dont irritate him unnecessarily had been wendys instructions in the hold so tootles stepped forward politely
all children know this about mothers and despise them for it but make constant use of it
so tootles explained prudently you see sir i dont think my mother would like me to be a pirate
would your mother like you to be a pirate slightly
he winked at slightly who said mournfully i dont think so as if he wished things had been otherwise
would your mother like you to be a pirate twin
i dont think so said the first twin as clever as the others
nibs would stow this gab roared hook and the spokesmen were dragged back
you boy he said addressing john you look as if you had a little pluck in you
didst never want to be a pirate my hearty
now john had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths
and he was struck by hooks picking him out
i once thought of calling myself redhanded jack he said diffidently
and a good name too
well call you that here bully if you join
what do you think michael
asked john
what would you call me if i join
michael demanded
blackbeard joe
michael was naturally impressed
what do you think john
john to decide and john wanted him to decide
shall we still be respectful subjects of the king
john inquired
through hooks teeth came the answer you would have to swear down with the king
perhaps john had not behaved very well so far but he shone out now
then i refuse he cried banging the barrel in front of hook
and i refuse cried michael
rule britannia
squeaked curly
the infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth and hook roared out that seals your doom
bring up their mother
get the plank ready
they were only boys and they went white as they saw jukes and cecco preparing the fatal plank
but they tried to look brave when wendy was brought up
no words of mine can tell you how wendy despised those pirates
to the boys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling but all that she saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years
there was not a porthole on the grimy glass of which you might not have written with your finger dirty pig and she had already written it on several
but as the boys gathered round her she had no thought of course save for them
so my beauty said hook as if he spoke in syrup you are to see your children walk the plank
fine gentlemen though he was the intensity of his communings had soiled his ruff and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it
with a hasty gesture he tried to hide it but he was too late
are they to die
asked wendy with a look of such frightful contempt that he nearly fainted
they are he snarled
silence all he called gloatingly for a mothers last words to her children
at this moment wendy was grand
these are my last words dear boys she said firmly
i feel that i have a message to you from your real mothers and it is this we hope our sons will die like english gentlemen
even the pirates were awed and tootles cried out hysterically i am going to do what my mother hopes
what are you to do nibs
what my mother hopes
what are you to do twin
what my mother hopes
john what are
but hook had found his voice again
tie her up
he shouted
it was smee who tied her to the mast
see here honey he whispered ill save you if you promise to be my mother
but not even for smee would she make such a promise
i would almost rather have no children at all she said disdainfully
it is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as smee tied her to the mast the eyes of all were on the plank that last little walk they were about to take
they were no longer able to hope that they would walk it manfully for the capacity to think had gone from them they could stare and shiver only
hook smiled on them with his teeth closed and took a step toward
his intention was to turn her face so that she should see the boys walking the plank one by one
but he never reached her he never heard the cry of anguish he hoped to wring from her
he heard something else instead
it was the terrible ticktick of the crocodile
they all heard itpirates boys wendy and immediately every head was blown in one direction not to the water whence the sound proceeded but toward hook
all knew that what was about to happen concerned him alone and that from being actors they were suddenly become spectators
very frightful was it to see the change that came over him
it was as if he had been clipped at every joint
he fell in a little heap
the sound came steadily nearer and in advance of it came this ghastly thought the crocodile is about to board the ship
even the iron claw hung inactive as if knowing that it was no intrinsic part of what the attacking force wanted
the pirates respectfully cleared a passage for him and it was only when he brought up against the bulwarks that he spoke
he cried hoarsely
they gathered round him all eyes averted from the thing that was coming aboard
they had no thought of fighting it
it was fate
only when hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of the boys so that they could rush to the ships side to see the crocodile climbing it
then they got the strangest surprise of the
night of nights for it was no crocodile that was coming to their aid
it was peter
he signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might rouse suspicion
then he went on ticking
chapter xv
hook or me this time
odd things happen to all of us on our way through life without our noticing for a time that they have happened
thus to take an instance we suddenly discover that we have been deaf in one ear for we dont know how long but say half an hour
now such an experience had come that night to peter
when last we saw him he was stealing across the island with one finger to his lips and his dagger at the ready
he had seen the crocodile pass by without noticing anything peculiar about it but by and by he remembered that it had not been ticking
at first he thought this eerie but soon concluded rightly that the clock had run down
he ticked superbly but with one unforeseen result
peter reached the shore without mishap and went straight on his legs encountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new element
thus many animals pass from land to water but no other human of whom i know
as he swam he had but one thought hook or me this time
he had ticked so long that he now went on ticking without knowing that he was doing it
had he known he would have stopped for to board the brig by help of the tick though an ingenious idea had not occurred to him
on the contrary he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a mouse and he was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him with
hook in their midst as abject as if he had heard the crocodile
the crocodile
no sooner did peter remember it than he heard the ticking
at first he thought the sound did come from the crocodile and he looked behind him swiftly
then he realised that he was doing it himself and in a flash he understood the situation
how clever of me
he thought at once and signed to the boys not to burst into applause
it was at this moment that ed teynte the quartermaster emerged from the forecastle and came along the deck
now reader time what happened by your watch
peter struck true and deep
john clapped his hands on the illfated pirates mouth to stifle the dying groan
he fell forward
four boys caught him to prevent the thud
peter gave the signal and the carrion was cast overboard
there was a splash and then silence
how long has it taken
slightly had begun to count
none too soon peter every inch of him on tiptoe vanished into the cabin for more than one pirate was screwing up his courage to look round
they could hear each others distressed breathing now which showed them that the more terrible sound had passed
its gone captain smee said wiping off his spectacles
alls still again
slowly hook let his head emerge from his ruff and listened so intently that he could have caught the echo of the tick
there was not a sound and he drew himself up firmly to his full height
then heres to johnny plank
he cried brazenly hating the boys more than ever because they had seen him unbend
he broke into the villainous ditty yo ho yo ho the frisky plank you walks along it so
till it goes down and you goes down to davy jones below
at that they fell on their knees
they cried so piteously that every pirate smiled
fetch the cat jukes said hook its in the cabin
peter was in the cabin
the children gazed at each other
ay ay said jukes blithely and he strode into the cabin
they followed him with their eyes they scarce knew that hook had resumed his song his dogs joining in with him yo ho yo ho the scratching cat its tails are nine you know
and when theyre writ upon your back
what was the last line will never be known for of a sudden the song was stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin
it wailed through the ship and died away
then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood by the boys but to the pirates was almost more eerie than the screech
what was that
cried hook
two said slightly solemnly
the italian cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin
he tottered out haggard
whats the matter with bill jukes you dog
hissed hook towering over him
the matter wi him is hes dead stabbed replied cecco in a hollow voice
bill jukes dead
cried the startled pirates
the cabins as black as a pit cecco said almost gibbering but there is something terrible in there the thing you heard crowing
the exultation of the boys the lowering looks of the pirates both were seen by hook
cecco he said in his most steely voice go back and fetch me out that doodledoo
cecco bravest of the brave cowered before his captain crying no no but hook was purring to his claw
did you say you would go cecco
he said musingly
cecco went first flinging his arms despairingly
there was no more singing all listened now and again came a deathscreech and again a crow
no one spoke except slightly
three he said
hook rallied his dogs with a gesture
sdeath and odds fish he thundered who is to bring me that doodledoo
wait till cecco comes out growled starkey and the others took up the cry
i think i heard you volunteer starkey said hook purring again
no by thunder
starkey cried
my hook thinks you did said hook crossing to him
i wonder if it would not be advisable starkey to humour the hook
ill swing before i go in there replied starkey doggedly and again he had the support of the crew
is this mutiny
asked hook more pleasantly than ever
starkeys ringleader
captain mercy
starkey whimpered all of a tremble now
shake hands starkey said hook proffering his claw
starkey looked round for help but all deserted him
as he backed up
hook advanced and now the red spark was in his eye
with a despairing scream the pirate leapt upon long tom and precipitated himself into the sea
four said slightly
and now hook said courteously did any other gentlemen say mutiny
seizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacing gesture ill bring out that doodledoo myself he said and sped into the cabin
how slightly longed to say it
he wetted his lips to be ready but hook came staggering out without his lantern
something blew out the light he said a little unsteadily
echoed mullins
what of cecco
demanded noodler
hes as dead as jukes said hook shortly
his reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all unfavourably and the mutinous sounds again broke forth
all pirates are superstitious and cookson cried they do say the surest sign a ships accurst is when theres one on board more than can be accounted for
ive heard muttered mullins he always boards the pirate craft last
had he a tail captain
they say said another looking viciously at hook that when he comes its in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard
had he a hook captain
asked cookson insolently and one after another took up the cry the ships doomed
at this the children could not resist raising a cheer
hook had wellnigh forgotten his prisoners but as he swung round on them now his face lit up again
lads he cried to his crew now heres a notion
open the cabin door and drive them in
let them fight the doodledoo for their lives
if they kill him were so much the better if he kills them were none the worse
for the last time his dogs admired hook and devotedly they did his bidding
the boys pretending to struggle were pushed into the cabin and the door was closed on them
now listen
cried hook and all listened
but not one dared to face the door
yes one wendy who all this time had been bound to the mast
it was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was watching it was for the reappearance of peter
she had not long to wait
in the cabin he had found the thing for which he had gone in search the key that would free the children of their manacles and now they all stole forth armed with such weapons as they could find
first signing them to hide peter cut wendys bonds and then nothing could have been easier than for them all to fly off together but one thing barred the way an oath hook or me this time
so when he had freed wendy he whispered for her to conceal herself with the others and himself took her place by the mast her cloak around him so that he should pass for her
then he took a great breath and crowed
to the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the cabin and they were panicstricken
hook tried to hearten them but like the dogs he had made them they showed him their fangs and he knew that if he took his eyes off them now they would leap at him
lads he said ready to cajole or strike as need be but never quailing for an instant ive thought it out
theres a jonah aboard
ay they snarled a man wi a hook
no lads no its the girl
never was luck on a pirate ship wi a woman on board
well right the ship when shes gone
some of them remembered that this had been a saying of flints
its worth trying they said doubtfully
fling the girl overboard cried hook and they made a rush at the figure in the cloak
theres none can save you now missy mullins hissed jeeringly
theres one replied the figure
peter pan the avenger
came the terrible answer and as he spoke
peter flung off his cloak
then they all knew who twas that had been undoing them in the cabin and twice hook essayed to speak and twice he failed
in that frightful moment i think his fierce heart broke
at last he cried cleave him to the brisket
but without conviction
down boys and at them
peters voice rang out and in another moment the clash of arms was resounding through the ship
man to man they were the stronger but they fought on the defensive only which enabled the boys to hunt in pairs and choose their quarry
there was little sound to be heard but the clang of weapons an occasional screech or splash and slightly monotonously countingfivesixseveneightnineteneleven
i think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded hook who seemed to have a charmed life as he kept them at bay in that circle of fire
they had done for his dogs but this man alone seemed to be a match for them all
again and again they closed upon him and again and again he hewed a clear space
he had lifted up one boy with his hook and was using him as a buckler when another who had just passed his sword through mullins sprang into the fray
put up your swords boys cried the newcomer this man is mine
thus suddenly hook found himself face to face with peter
the others drew back and formed a ring around them
for long the two enemies looked at one another hook shuddering slightly and peter with the strange smile upon his face
so pan said hook at last this is all your doing
ay james hook came the stern answer it is all my doing
proud and insolent youth said hook prepare to meet thy doom
dark and sinister man peter answered have at thee
without more words they fell to and for a space there was no advantage to either blade
then he sought to close and give the quietus with his iron hook which all this time had been pawing the air but peter doubled under it and lunging fiercely pierced him in the ribs
at the sight of his own blood whose peculiar colour you remember was offensive to him the sword fell from hooks hand and he was at peters mercy
cried all the boys but with a magnificent gesture peter invited his opponent to pick up his sword
hook did so instantly but with a tragic feeling that peter was showing good form
hitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him but darker suspicions assailed him now
pan who and what art thou
he cried huskily
im youth im joy peter answered at a venture im a little bird that has broken out of the egg
this of course was nonsense but it was proof to the unhappy hook that peter did not know in the least who or what he was which is the very pinnacle of good form
tot again he cried despairingly
he fought now like a human flail and every sweep of that terrible sword would have severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it but
peter fluttered round him as if the very wind it made blew him out of the danger zone
and again and again he darted in and pricked
hook was fighting now without hope
that passionate breast no longer asked for life but for one boon it craved to see peter show bad form before it was cold forever
abandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it
in two minutes he cried the ship will be blown to pieces
now now he thought true form will show
but peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his hands and calmly flung it overboard
what sort of form was hook himself showing
misguided man though he was we may be glad without sympathising with him that in the end he was true to the traditions of his race
and his shoes were right and his waistcoat was right and his tie was right and his socks were right
james hook thou not wholly unheroic figure farewell
for we have come to his last moment
seeing peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger poised he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea
he did not know that the crocodile was waiting for him for we purposely stopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared him a little mark of respect from us at the end
he had one last triumph which i think we need not grudge him
as he stood on the bulwark looking over his shoulder at peter gliding through the air he invited him with a gesture to use his foot
it made peter kick instead of stab
at last hook had got the boon for which he craved
bad form he cried jeeringly and went content to the crocodile
thus perished james hook
seventeen slightly sang out but he was not quite correct in his figures
fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night but two reached the shore starkey to be captured by the redskins who made him nurse for all their papooses a melancholy comedown for a pirate and
smee who henceforth wandered about the world in his spectacles making a precarious living by saying he was the only man that jas
hook had feared
wendy of course had stood by taking no part in the fight though watching peter with glistening eyes but now that all was over she became prominent again
it said halfpast one
the lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all
she got them to bed in the pirates bunks pretty quickly you may be sure all but peter who strutted up and down on the deck until at last he fell asleep by the side of long tom
he had one of his dreams that night and cried in his sleep for a long time and wendy held him tightly
chapter xvi
the return home
by three bells that morning they were all stirring their stumps for there was a big sea running and tootles the bosun was among them with a ropes end in his hand and chewing tobacco
they all donned pirate clothes cut off at the knee shaved smartly and tumbled up with the true nautical roll and hitching their trousers
it need not be said who was the captain
nibs and john were first and second mate
there was a woman aboard
the rest were tars before the mast and lived in the focsle
the bluff strident words struck the note sailors understood and they cheered him lustily
then a few sharp orders were given and they turned the ship round and nosed her for the mainland
captain pan calculated after consulting the ships chart that if this weather lasted they should strike the azores about the st of june after which it would save time to fly
some of them wanted it to be an honest ship and others were in favour of keeping it a pirate but the captain treated them as dogs and they dared not express their wishes to him even in a round robin
instant obedience was the only safe thing
slightly got a dozen for looking perplexed when told to take soundings
the general feeling was that
peter was honest just now to lull wendys suspicions but that there might be a change when the new suit was ready which against her will she was making for him out of some of hooks wickedest garments
instead of watching the ship however we must now return to that desolate home from which three of our characters had taken heartless flight so long ago
it seems a shame to have neglected no
all this time and yet we may be sure that mrs
darling does not blame us
if we had returned sooner to look with sorrowful sympathy at her she would probably have cried dont be silly what do i matter
do go back and keep an eye on the children
so long as mothers are like this their children will take advantage of them and they may lay to that
darling do not go out for the evening
we are no more than servants
why on earth should their beds be properly aired seeing that they left them in such a thankless hurry
would it not serve them jolly well right if they came back and found that their parents were spending the weekend in the country
it would be the moral lesson they have been in need of ever since we met them but if we contrived things in this way
darling would never forgive us
one thing i should like to do immensely and that is to tell her in the way authors have that the children are coming back that indeed they will be here on thursday week
this would spoil so completely the surprise to which wendy and john and michael are looking forward
they have been planning it out on the ship mothers rapture fathers shout of joy nanas leap through the air to embrace them first when what they ought to be prepared for is a good hiding
how delicious to spoil it all by breaking the news in advance so that when they enter grandly
darling may not even offer wendy her mouth and mr
darling may exclaim pettishly dash it all here are those boys again
however we should get no thanks even for this
we are beginning to know mrs
darling by this time and may be sure that she would upbraid us for depriving the children of their little pleasure
but my dear madam it is ten days till thursday week so that by telling you whats what we can save you ten days of unhappiness
yes but at what a cost
by depriving the children of ten minutes of delight
oh if you look at it in that way
what other way is there in which to look at it
you see the woman had no proper spirit
i had meant to say extraordinarily nice things about her but i despise her and not one of them will i say now
she does not really need to be told to have things ready for they are ready
all the beds are aired and she never leaves the house and observe the window is open
for all the use we are to her we might well go back to the ship
however as we are here we may as well stay and look on
that is all we are lookerson
nobody really wants us
so let us watch and say jaggy things in the hope that some of them will hurt
the only change to be seen in the nightnursery is that between nine and six the kennel is no longer there
when the children flew away mr
darling felt in his bones that all the blame was his for having chained
nana up and that from first to last she had been wiser than he
to all mrs
darlings dear invitations to him to come out he replied sadly but firmly no my own one this is the place for me
in the bitterness of his remorse he swore that he would never leave the kennel until his children came back
of course this was a pity but whatever mr
darling did he had to do in excess otherwise he soon gave up doing it
and there never was a more humble man than the once proud
george darling as he sat in the kennel of an evening talking with his wife of their children and all their pretty ways
very touching was his deference to nana
he would not let her come into the kennel but on all other matters he followed her wishes implicitly
every morning the kennel was carried with mr
darling in it to a cab which conveyed him to his office and he returned home in the same way at six
something of the strength of character of the man will be seen if we remember how sensitive he was to the opinion of neighbours this man whose every movement now attracted surprised attention
inwardly he must have suffered torture but he preserved a calm exterior even when the young criticised his little home and he always lifted his hat courteously to any lady who looked inside
it may have been quixotic but it was magnificent
soon the inward meaning of it leaked out and the great heart of the public was touched
on that eventful thursday week mrs
darling was in the nightnursery awaiting georges return home a very sadeyed woman
now that we look at her closely and remember the gaiety of her in the old days all gone now just because she has lost her babes i find i wont be able to say nasty things about her after all
if she was too fond of her rubbishy children she couldnt help it
look at her in her chair where she has fallen asleep
the corner of her mouth where one looks first is almost withered up
her hand moves restlessly on her breast as if she had a pain there
some like peter best and some like wendy best but i like her best
suppose to make her happy we whisper to her in her sleep that the brats are coming back
they are really within two miles of the window now and flying strong but all we need whisper is that they are on the way
it is a pity we did it for she has started up calling their names and there is no one in the room but nana
o nana i dreamt my dear ones had come back
nana had filmy eyes but all she could do was put her paw gently on her mistresss lap and they were sitting together thus when the kennel was brought back
darling puts his head out to kiss his wife we see that his face is more worn than of yore but has a softer expression
he gave his hat to liza who took it scornfully for she had no imagination and was quite incapable of understanding the motives of such a man
outside the crowd who had accompanied the cab home were still cheering and he was naturally not unmoved
listen to them he said it is very gratifying
lots of little boys sneered liza
there were several adults today he assured her with a faint flush but when she tossed her head he had not a word of reproof for her
social success had not spoilt him it had made him sweeter
for some time he sat with his head out of the kennel talking with mrs
darling of this success and pressing her hand reassuringly when she said she hoped his head would not be turned by it
but if i had been a weak man he said
good heavens if i had been a weak man
and george she said timidly you are as full of remorse as ever arent you
full of remorse as ever dearest
see my punishment living in a kennel
but it is punishment isnt it george
you are sure you are not enjoying it
you may be sure she begged his pardon and then feeling drowsy he curled round in the kennel
wont you play me to sleep he asked on the nursery piano
and as she was crossing to the daynursery he added thoughtlessly and shut that window
i feel a draught
o george never ask me to do that
the window must always be left open for them always always
now it was his turn to beg her pardon and she went into the daynursery and played and soon he was asleep and while he slept
wendy and john and michael flew into the room
peters first words tell all
quick tink he whispered close the window bar it
thats right
now you and i must get away by the door and when wendy comes she will think her mother has barred her out and she will have to go back with me
now i understand what had hitherto puzzled me why when peter had exterminated the pirates he did not return to the island and leave tink to escort the children to the mainland
this trick had been in his head all the time
instead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee then he peeped into the daynursery to see who was playing
he whispered to
tink its wendys mother
she is a pretty lady but not so pretty as my mother
her mouth is full of thimbles but not so full as my mothers was
of course he knew nothing whatever about his mother but he sometimes bragged about her
he did not know the tune which was home sweet home but he knew it was saying come back wendy wendy wendy and he cried exultantly you will never see wendy again lady for the window is barred
he peeped in again to see why the music had stopped and now he saw that mrs
darling had laid her head on the box and that two tears were sitting on her eyes
she wants me to unbar the window thought peter but i wont not
he peeped again and the tears were still there or another two had taken their place
shes awfully fond of wendy he said to himself
he was angry with her now for not seeing why she could not have wendy
the reason was so simple im fond of her too
we cant both have her lady
but the lady would not make the best of it and he was unhappy
he ceased to look at her but even then she would not let go of him
he skipped about and made funny faces but when he stopped it was just as if she were inside him knocking
oh all right he said at last and gulped
then he unbarred the window
come on tink he cried with a frightful sneer at the laws of nature we dont want any silly mothers and he flew away
thus wendy and john and michael found the window open for them after all which of course was more than they deserved
they alighted on the floor quite unashamed of themselves and the youngest one had already forgotten his home
john he said looking around him doubtfully i think i have been here before
of course you have you silly
there is your old bed
so it is michael said but not with much conviction
i say cried john the kennel
and he dashed across to look into it
perhaps nana is inside it wendy said
but john whistled
hullo he said theres a man inside it
its father
exclaimed wendy
let me see father michael begged eagerly and he took a good look
he is not so big as the pirate i killed he said with such frank disappointment that i am glad mr
darling was asleep it would have been sad if those had been the first words he heard his little michael say
wendy and john had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in the kennel
surely said john like one who had lost faith in his memory he used not to sleep in the kennel
john wendy said falteringly perhaps we dont remember the old life as well as we thought we did
a chill fell upon them and serve them right
it is very careless of mother said that young scoundrel john not to be here when we come back
it was then that mrs
darling began playing again
its mother
cried wendy peeping
then are you not really our mother wendy
asked michael who was surely sleepy
exclaimed wendy with her first real twinge of remorse it was quite time we came back
let us creep in john suggested and put our hands over her eyes
but wendy who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently had a better plan
let us all slip into our beds and be there when she comes in just as if we had never been away
and so when mrs
darling went back to the nightnursery to see if her husband was asleep all the beds were occupied
the children waited for her cry of joy but it did not come
she saw them but she did not believe they were there
you see she saw them in their beds so often in her dreams that she thought this was just the dream hanging around her still
she sat down in the chair by the fire where in the old days she had nursed them
they could not understand this and a cold fear fell upon all the three of them
wendy cried
thats wendy she said but still she was sure it was the dream
thats john she said
cried michael
he knew her now
thats michael she said and she stretched out her arms for the three little selfish children they would never envelop again
yes they did they went round wendy and john and michael who had slipped out of bed and run to her
george george
she cried when she could speak and mr
darling woke to share her bliss and nana came rushing in
there could not have been a lovelier sight but there was none to see it except a little boy who was staring in at the window
he had had ecstasies innumerable that other children can never know but he was looking through the window at the one joy from which he must be for ever barred
chapter xvii
when wendy grew up
i hope you want to know what became of the other boys
they were waiting below to give wendy time to explain about them and when they had counted five hundred they went up
they went up by the stair because they thought this would make a better impression
they stood in a row in front of mrs
darling with their hats off and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes
they said nothing but their eyes asked her to have them
they ought to have looked at mr
darling also but they forgot about him
of course mrs
darling said at once that she would have them but mr
darling was curiously depressed and they saw that he considered six a rather large number
i must say he said to wendy that you dont do things by halves a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them
the first twin was the proud one and he asked flushing do you think we should be too much of a handful sir
because if so we can go away
wendy cried shocked but still the cloud was on him
he knew he was behaving unworthily but he could not help it
we could lie doubled up said nibs
i always cut their hair myself said wendy
darling exclaimed pained to see her dear one showing himself in such an unfavourable light
then he burst into tears and the truth came out
he was as glad to have them as she was he said but he thought they should have asked his consent as well as hers instead of treating him as a cypher in his own house
i dont think he is a cypher tootles cried instantly
do you think he is a cypher curly
do you think he is a cypher slightly
rather not
twin what do you think
it turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher and he was absurdly gratified and said he would find space for them all in the drawingroom if they fitted in
well fit in sir they assured him
then follow the leader he cried gaily
mind you i am not sure that we have a drawingroom but we pretend we have and its all the same
he went off dancing through the house and they all cried hoop la
and danced after him searching for the drawingroom and i forget whether they found it but at any rate they found corners and they all fitted in
as for peter he saw wendy once again before he flew away
he did not exactly come to the window but he brushed against it in passing so that she could open it if she liked and call to him
that is what she did
hullo wendy goodbye he said
oh dear are you going away
you dont feel peter she said falteringly that you would like to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject
about me peter
darling came to the window for at present she was keeping a sharp eye on wendy
she told peter that she had adopted all the other boys and would like to adopt him also
would you send me to school
he inquired craftily
and then to an office
i suppose so
soon i would be a man
i dont want to go to school and learn solemn things he told her passionately
i dont want to be a man
o wendys mother if i was to wake up and feel there was a beard
peter said wendy the comforter i should love you in a beard and
darling stretched out her arms to him but he repulsed her
keep back lady no one is going to catch me and make me a man
but where are you going to live
with tink in the house we built for wendy
the fairies are to put it high up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights
how lovely cried wendy so longingly that mrs
darling tightened her grip
i thought all the fairies were dead mrs
darling said
they live in nests on the tops of trees and the mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls and the blue ones are just little sillies who are not sure what they are
i shall have such fun said peter with eye on wendy
it will be rather lonely in the evening she said sitting by the fire
i shall have tink
tink cant go a twentieth part of the way round she reminded him a little tartly
sneaky telltale
tink called out from somewhere round the corner
it doesnt matter peter said
o peter you know it matters
well then come with me to the little house
may i mummy
certainly not
i have got you home again and i mean to keep you
but he does so need a mother
so do you my love
oh all right peter said as if he had asked her from politeness merely but mrs
darling saw his mouth twitch and she made this handsome offer to let wendy go to him for a week every year to do his spring cleaning
wendy would have preferred a more permanent arrangement and it seemed to her that spring would be long in coming but this promise sent peter away quite gay again
he had no sense of time and was so full of adventures that all i have told you about him is only a halfpennyworth of them
i suppose it was because wendy knew this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones you wont forget me peter will you before spring cleaning time comes
of course peter promised and then he flew away
he took mrs
darlings kiss with him
the kiss that had been for no one else peter took quite easily
but she seemed satisfied
of course all the boys went to school and most of them got into class
iii but slightly was put first into class iv and then into class v
class i is the top class
it is sad to have to say that the power to fly gradually left them
in time they could not even fly after their hats
want of practice they called it but what it really meant was that they no longer believed
michael believed longer than the other boys though they jeered at him so he was with wendy when peter came for her at the end of the first year
she had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times but new adventures had crowded the old ones from his mind
who is captain hook
he asked with interest when she spoke of the arch enemy
dont you remember she asked amazed how you killed him and saved all our lives
i forget them after i kill them he replied carelessly
when she expressed a doubtful hope that tinker bell would be glad to see her he said who is tinker bell
o peter she said shocked but even when she explained he could not remember
there are such a lot of them he said
i expect she is no more
i expect he was right for fairies dont live long but they are so little that a short time seems a good while to them
wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to
peter it had seemed such a long year of waiting to her
but he was exactly as fascinating as ever and they had a lovely spring cleaning in the little house on the tree tops
next year he did not come for her
she waited in a new frock because the old one simply would not meet but he never came
perhaps he is ill michael said
you know he is never ill
michael came close to her and whispered with a shiver perhaps there is no such person wendy
and then wendy would have cried if michael had not been crying
peter came next spring cleaning and the strange thing was that he never knew he had missed a year
that was the last time the girl wendy ever saw him
for a little longer she tried for his sake not to have growing pains and she felt she was untrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge
wendy was grown up
you need not be sorry for her
she was one of the kind that likes to grow up
in the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker than other girls
all the boys were grown up and done for by this time so it is scarcely worth while saying anything more about them
you may see the twins and
nibs and curly any day going to an office each carrying a little bag and an umbrella
michael is an enginedriver
slightly married a lady of title and so he became a lord
you see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door
that used to be tootles
the bearded man who doesnt know any story to tell his children was once john
wendy was married in white with a pink sash
it is strange to think that peter did not alight in the church and forbid the banns
years rolled on again and wendy had a daughter
this ought not to be written in ink but in a golden splash
she was called jane and always had an odd inquiring look as if from the moment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions
when she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about peter pan
she loved to hear of peter and wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place
it was janes nursery now for her father had bought it at the three per cents from wendys father who was no longer fond of stairs
darling was now dead and forgotten
there were only two beds in the nursery now janes and her nurses and there was no kennel for nana also had passed away
she died of old age and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except herself
once a week janes nurse had her evening off and then it was wendys part to put jane to bed
that was the time for stories
it was janes invention to raise the sheet over her mothers head and her own thus making a tent and in the awful darkness to whisper what do we see now
i dont think i see anything tonight says wendy with a feeling that if nana were here she would object to further conversation
yes you do says jane you see when you were a little girl
that is a long time ago sweetheart says wendy
ah me how time flies
does it fly asks the artful child the way you flew when you were a little girl
the way i flew
do you know jane i sometimes wonder whether i ever did really fly
yes you did
the dear old days when i could fly
why cant you fly now mother
because i am grown up dearest
when people grow up they forget the way
why do they forget the way
because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless
it is only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly
what is gay and innocent and heartless
i do wish i were gay and innocent and heartless
or perhaps wendy admits she does see something
i do believe she says that it is this nursery
i do believe it is says jane
they are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when peter flew in looking for his shadow
the foolish fellow says wendy tried to stick it on with soap and when he could not he cried and that woke me and i sewed it on for him
you have missed a bit interrupts jane who now knows the story better than her mother
when you saw him sitting on the floor crying what did you say
i sat up in bed and i said boy why are you crying
yes that was it says jane with a big breath
and then he flew us all away to the neverland and the fairies and the pirates and the redskins and the mermaids lagoon and the home under the ground and the little house
which did you like best of all
i think i liked the home under the ground best of all
yes so do i
what was the last thing peter ever said to you
the last thing he ever said to me was just always be waiting for me and then some night you will hear me crowing
but alas he forgot all about me wendy said it with a smile
she was as grown up as that
what did his crow sound like
jane asked one evening
it was like this wendy said trying to imitate peters crow
no it wasnt jane said gravely it was like this and she did it ever so much better than her mother
wendy was a little startled
my darling how can you know
i often hear it when i am sleeping jane said
ah yes many girls hear it when they are sleeping but i was the only one who heard it awake
lucky you said jane
and then one night came the tragedy
it was the spring of the year and the story had been told for the night and jane was now asleep in her bed
wendy was sitting on the floor very close to the fire so as to see to darn for there was no other light in the nursery and while she sat darning she heard a crow
then the window blew open as of old and
peter dropped in on the floor
he was exactly the same as ever and wendy saw at once that he still had all his first teeth
he was a little boy and she was grown up
she huddled by the fire not daring to move helpless and guilty a big woman
hullo wendy he said not noticing any difference for he was thinking chiefly of himself and in the dim light her white dress might have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first
hullo peter she replied faintly squeezing herself as small as possible
something inside her was crying woman woman let go of me
hullo where is john
he asked suddenly missing the third bed
john is not here now she gasped
is michael asleep
he asked with a careless glance at jane
yes she answered and now she felt that she was untrue to jane as well as to peter
that is not michael she said quickly lest a judgment should fall on her
peter looked
hullo is it a new one
boy or girl
now surely he would understand but not a bit of it
peter she said faltering are you expecting me to fly away with you
of course that is why i have come
he added a little sternly have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time
she knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning times pass
i cant come she said apologetically i have forgotten how to fly
ill soon teach you again
o peter dont waste the fairy dust on me
she had risen and now at last a fear assailed him
what is it
he cried shrinking
i will turn up the light she said and then you can see for yourself
for almost the only time in his life that i know of peter was afraid
dont turn up the light he cried
she let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy
she was not a little girl heartbroken about him she was a grown woman smiling at it all but they were weteyed smiles
then she turned up the light and peter saw
he gave a cry of pain and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew back sharply
what is it
he cried again
she had to tell him
i am old peter
i am ever so much more than twenty
i grew up long ago
you promised not to
i couldnt help it
i am a married woman peter
no youre not
yes and the little girl in the bed is my baby
no shes not
but he supposed she was and he took a step towards the sleeping child with his dagger upraised
of course he did not strike
he sat down on the floor instead and sobbed and wendy did not know how to comfort him though she could have done it so easily once
she was only a woman now and she ran out of the room to try to think
peter continued to cry and soon his sobs woke jane
she sat up in bed and was interested at once
boy she said why are you crying
peter rose and bowed to her and she bowed to him from the bed
hullo he said
hullo said jane
my name is peter pan he told her
yes i know
i came back for my mother he explained to take her to the
yes i know jane said i have been waiting for you
when wendy returned diffidently she found peter sitting on the bedpost crowing gloriously while jane in her nighty was flying round the room in solemn ecstasy
she is my mother peter explained and jane descended and stood by his side with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when they gazed at him
he does so need a mother jane said
yes i know wendy admitted rather forlornly no one knows it so well as i
goodbye said peter to wendy and he rose in the air and the shameless jane rose with him it was already her easiest way of moving about
wendy rushed to the window
no no she cried
it is just for spring cleaning time jane said he wants me always to do his spring cleaning
if only i could go with you wendy sighed
you see you cant fly said jane
of course in the end wendy let them fly away together
our last glimpse of her shows her at the window watching them receding into the sky until they were as small as stars
as you look at wendy you may see her hair becoming white and her figure little again for all this happened long ago
when margaret grows up she will have a daughter who is to be peters mother in turn and thus it will go on so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless
