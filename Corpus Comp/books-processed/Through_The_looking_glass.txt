child of the pure unclouded brow and dreaming eyes of wonder
though time be fleet and i and thou are half a life asunder
thy loving smile will surely hail
the lovegift of a fairytale
i have not seen thy sunny face nor heard thy silver laughter
no thought of me shall find a place in thy young lifes hereafter
enough that now thou wilt not fail
to listen to my fairytale
a tale begun in other days when summer suns were glowing
a simple chime that served to time the rhythm of oar rowing
whose echoes live in memory yet
though envious years would say forget
come hearken then ere voice of dread
with bitter tidings laden
shall summon to unwelcome bed a melancholy maiden
we are but older children dear
who fret to find our bedtime near
without the frost the blinding snow
the stormwinds moody madness
within the firelights ruddy glow and childhoods nest of gladness
the magic words shall hold thee fast
thou shalt not heed the raving blast
and though the shadow of a sigh may tremble through the story
for happy summer days gone by and vanishd summer glory
it shall not touch with breath of bale
the pleasance of our fairytale

which dreamed it
lookingglass house
one thing was certain that the white kitten had had nothing to do with itit was the black kittens fault entirely
for the white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour and bearing it pretty well considering so you see that it couldnt have had any hand in the mischief
oh you wicked little thing
cried alice catching up the kitten and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace
really dinah ought to have taught you better manners
dinah you know you ought
but she didnt get on very fast as she was talking all the time sometimes to the kitten and sometimes to herself
kitty sat very demurely on her knee pretending to watch the progress of the winding and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball as if it would be glad to help if it might
do you know what tomorrow is kitty
alice began
youd have guessed if youd been up in the window with meonly dinah was making you tidy so you couldnt
i was watching the boys getting in sticks for the bonfireand it wants plenty of sticks kitty
only it got so cold and it snowed so they had to leave off
never mind kitty well go and see the bonfire tomorrow
and youd have deserved it you little mischievous darling
what have you got to say for yourself
now dont interrupt me
she went on holding up one finger
im going to tell you all your faults
number one you squeaked twice while dinah was washing your face this morning
now you cant deny it kitty i heard you
whats that you say
pretending that the kitten was speaking
her paw went into your eye
well thats your fault for keeping your eyes openif youd shut them tight up it wouldnt have happened
now dont make any more excuses but listen
number two you pulled
snowdrop away by the tail just as i had put down the saucer of milk before her
what you were thirsty were you
how do you know she wasnt thirsty too
now for number three you unwound every bit of the worsted while i wasnt looking
thats three faults kitty and youve not been punished for any of them yet
you know im saving up all your punishments for wednesday weeksuppose they had saved up all my punishments
she went on talking more to herself than the kitten
what would they do at the end of a year
i should be sent to prison i suppose when the day came
orlet me seesuppose each punishment was to be going without a dinner then when the miserable day came i should have to go without fifty dinners at once
well i shouldnt mind that much
id far rather go without them than eat them
do you hear the snow against the windowpanes kitty
how nice and soft it sounds
just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside
i wonder if the snow loves the trees and fields that it kisses them so gently
and then it covers them up snug you know with a white quilt and perhaps it says go to sleep darlings till the summer comes again
and when they wake up in the summer kitty they dress themselves all in green and dance aboutwhenever the wind blowsoh thats very pretty
cried alice dropping the ball of worsted to clap her hands
and i do so wish it was true
im sure the woods look sleepy in the autumn when the leaves are getting brown
kitty can you play chess
now dont smile my dear im asking it seriously
because when we were playing just now you watched just as if you understood it and when i said check
you purred
well it was a nice check kitty and really i might have won if it hadnt been for that nasty knight that came wiggling down among my pieces
kitty dear lets pretend and here i wish i could tell you half the things alice used to say beginning with her favourite phrase lets pretend
and once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in her ear nurse
do lets pretend that
im a hungry hyaena and youre a bone
but this is taking us away from alices speech to the kitten
lets pretend that youre the red queen kitty
do you know i think if you sat up and folded your arms youd look exactly like her
now do try theres a dear
so to punish it she held it up to the
lookingglass that it might see how sulky it wasand if youre not good directly she added ill put you through into lookingglass
how would you like that
now if youll only attend kitty and not talk so much ill tell you all my ideas about lookingglass house
first theres the room you can see through the glassthats just the same as our drawing room only the things go the other way
i can see all of it when i get upon a chairall but the bit behind the fireplace
i do so wish i could see that bit
well then the books are something like our books only the words go the wrong way i know that because ive held up one of our books to the glass and then they hold up one in the other room
how would you like to live in lookingglass house kitty
i wonder if theyd give you milk in there
perhaps lookingglass milk isnt good to drinkbut oh kitty
now we come to the passage
how nice it would be if we could only get through into
lookingglass house
im sure its got oh
such beautiful things in it
lets pretend theres a way of getting through into it somehow
lets pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze so that we can get through
why its turning into a sort of mist now i declare
itll be easy enough to get through she was up on the chimneypiece while she said this though she hardly knew how she had got there
and certainly the glass was beginning to melt away just like a bright silvery mist
in another moment alice was through the glass and had jumped lightly down into the lookingglass room
the very first thing she did was to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace and she was quite pleased to find that there was a real one blazing away as brightly as the one she had left behind
so i shall be as warm here as i was in the old room thought alice warmer in fact because therell be no one here to scold me away from the fire
oh what fun itll be when they see me through the glass in here and cant get at me
then she began looking about and noticed that what could be seen from the old room was quite common and uninteresting but that all the rest was as different as possible
for instance the pictures on the wall next the fire seemed to be all alive and the very clock on the chimneypiece you know you can only see the back of it in the
lookingglass had got the face of a little old man and grinned at her
they dont keep this room so tidy as the other alice thought to herself as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among the cinders but in another moment with a little oh
of surprise she was down on her hands and knees watching them
the chessmen were walking about two and two
here are the red king and the red queen alice said in a whisper for fear of frightening them and there are the white king and the
white queen sitting on the edge of the shoveland here are two castles walking arm in armi dont think they can hear me she went on as she put her head closer down and im nearly sure they cant see me
i feel somehow as if i were invisible
it is the voice of my child
the white queen cried out as she rushed past the king so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders
my precious lily
my imperial kitten
and she began scrambling wildly up the side of the fender
imperial fiddlestick
said the king rubbing his nose which had been hurt by the fall
he had a right to be a little annoyed with the
queen for he was covered with ashes from head to foot
the queen gasped and sat down the rapid journey through the air had quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing but hug the little lily in silence
as soon as she had recovered her breath a little she called out to the white king who was sitting sulkily among the ashes mind the volcano
what volcano
said the king looking up anxiously into the fire as if he thought that was the most likely place to find one
blewmeup panted the queen who was still a little out of breath
mind you come upthe regular waydont get blown up
alice watched the white king as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar till at last she said why youll be hours and hours getting to the table at that rate
id far better help you hadnt i
but the king took no notice of the question it was quite clear that he could neither hear her nor see her
please dont make such faces my dear
she cried out quite forgetting that the king couldnt hear her
you make me laugh so that
i can hardly hold you
and dont keep your mouth so wide open
all the ashes will get into itthere now i think youre tidy enough
she added as she smoothed his hair and set him upon the table near the
the king immediately fell flat on his back and lay perfectly still and alice was a little alarmed at what she had done and went round the room to see if she could find any water to throw over him
the king was saying i assure you my dear i turned cold to the very ends of my whiskers
to which the queen replied you havent got any whiskers
the horror of that moment the king went on i shall never never forget
you will though the queen said if you dont make a memorandum of it
alice looked on with great interest as the king took an enormous memorandumbook out of his pocket and began writing
a sudden thought struck her and she took hold of the end of the pencil which came some way over his shoulder and began writing for him
the poor king looked puzzled and unhappy and struggled with the pencil for some time without saying anything but alice was too strong for him and at last he panted out my dear
i really must get a thinner pencil
i cant manage this one a bit it writes all manner of things that i dont intend what manner of things
said the queen looking over the book in which alice had put the white knight is sliding down the poker
he balances very badly thats not a memorandum of your feelings
it was like this
ykcowrebbaj sevot yhtils eht dna gillirb sawt ebaw eht ni elbmig dna eryg did sevogorob eht erew ysmim lla
ebargtuo shtar emom eht dna
she puzzled over this for some time but at last a bright thought struck her
why its a lookingglass book of course
and if i hold it up to a glass the words will all go the right way again
this was the poem that alice read
jabberwocky
twas brillig and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe
all mimsy were the borogoves and the mome raths outgrabe
beware the jabberwock my son
the jaws that bite the claws that catch
beware the jubjub bird and shun the frumious bandersnatch
he took his vorpal sword in hand long time the manxome foe he sought
so rested he by the tumtum tree and stood awhile in thought
and as in uffish thought he stood the jabberwock with eyes of flame
came whiffling through the tulgey wood and burbled as it came
and through and through the vorpal blade went snickersnack
he left it dead and with its head he went galumphing back
and hast thou slain the jabberwock
come to my arms my beamish boy
o frabjous day
he chortled in his joy
twas brillig and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe
all mimsy were the borogoves and the mome raths outgrabe
it seems very pretty she said when she had finished it but its rather hard to understand
you see she didnt like to confess even to herself that she couldnt make it out at all
somehow it seems to fill my head with ideasonly i dont exactly know what they are
however somebody killed something thats clear at any rate but oh
thought alice suddenly jumping up if i dont make haste i shall have to go back through the lookingglass before ive seen what the rest of the house is like
lets have a look at the garden first
she was out of the room in a moment and ran down stairsor at least it wasnt exactly running but a new invention of hers for getting down stairs quickly and easily as alice said to herself
she was getting a little giddy with so much floating in the air and was rather glad to find herself walking again in the natural way
chapter ii
but how curiously it twists
its more like a corkscrew than a path
well this turn goes to the hill i supposeno it doesnt
this goes straight back to the house
well then ill try it the other way
and so she did wandering up and down and trying turn after turn but always coming back to the house do what she would
indeed once when she turned a corner rather more quickly than usual she ran against it before she could stop herself
its no use talking about it alice said looking up at the house and pretending it was arguing with her
im not going in again yet
i know i should have to get through the lookingglass againback into the old roomand thered be an end of all my adventures
so resolutely turning her back upon the house she set out once more down the path determined to keep straight on till she got to the hill
oh its too bad
i never saw such a house for getting in the way
however there was the hill full in sight so there was nothing to be done but start again
this time she came upon a large flowerbed with a border of daisies and a willowtree growing in the middle
o tigerlily said alice addressing herself to one that was waving gracefully about in the wind i wish you could talk
we can talk said the tigerlily when theres anybody worth talking to
alice was so astonished that she could not speak for a minute it quite seemed to take her breath away
at length as the tigerlily only went on waving about she spoke again in a timid voicealmost in a whisper
and can all the flowers talk
as well as you can said the tigerlily
and a great deal louder
it isnt manners for us to begin you know said the rose and i really was wondering when youd speak
said i to myself her face has got some sense in it though its not a clever one
still youre the right colour and that goes a long way
i dont care about the colour the tigerlily remarked
if only her petals curled up a little more shed be all right
alice didnt like being criticised so she began asking questions
arent you sometimes frightened at being planted out here with nobody to take care of you
theres the tree in the middle said the rose what else is it good for
but what could it do if any danger came
alice asked
it says boughwough
cried a daisy thats why its branches are called boughs
didnt you know that
cried another daisy and here they all began shouting together till the air seemed quite full of little shrill voices
silence every one of you
cried the tigerlily waving itself passionately from side to side and trembling with excitement
they know i cant get at them
it panted bending its quivering head towards alice or they wouldnt dare to do it
never mind
alice said in a soothing tone and stooping down to the daisies who were just beginning again she whispered if you dont hold your tongues ill pick you
there was silence in a moment and several of the pink daisies turned white
thats right
said the tigerlily
the daisies are worst of all
when one speaks they all begin together and its enough to make one wither to hear the way they go on
how is it you can all talk so nicely
alice said hoping to get it into a better temper by a compliment
ive been in many gardens before but none of the flowers could talk
put your hand down and feel the ground said the tigerlily
then youll know why
alice did so
its very hard she said but i dont see what that has to do with it
in most gardens the tigerlily said they make the beds too softso that the flowers are always asleep
this sounded a very good reason and alice was quite pleased to know it
i never thought of that before
its my opinion that you never think at all the rose said in a rather severe tone
i never saw anybody that looked stupider a violet said so suddenly that alice quite jumped for it hadnt spoken before
hold your tongue
cried the tigerlily
as if you ever saw anybody
you keep your head under the leaves and snore away there till you know no more whats going on in the world than if you were a bud
are there any more people in the garden besides me
alice said not choosing to notice the roses last remark
theres one other flower in the garden that can move about like you said the rose
i wonder how you do it youre always wondering said the tigerlily but shes more bushy than you are
is she like me
alice asked eagerly for the thought crossed her mind theres another little girl in the garden somewhere
well she has the same awkward shape as you the rose said but shes redderand her petals are shorter i think
her petals are done up close almost like a dahlia the tigerlily interrupted not tumbled about anyhow like yours
but thats not your fault the rose added kindly youre beginning to fade you knowand then one cant help ones petals getting a little untidy
alice didnt like this idea at all so to change the subject she asked does she ever come out here
i daresay youll see her soon said the rose
shes one of the thorny kind
where does she wear the thorns
alice asked with some curiosity
why all round her head of course the rose replied
i was wondering you hadnt got some too
i thought it was the regular rule
shes coming
cried the larkspur
i hear her footstep thump thump thump along the gravelwalk
alice looked round eagerly and found that it was the red queen
shes grown a good deal
was her first remark
she had indeed when alice first found her in the ashes she had been only three inches highand here she was half a head taller than alice herself
its the fresh air that does it said the rose wonderfully fine air it is out here
i think ill go and meet her said alice for though the flowers were interesting enough she felt that it would be far grander to have a talk with a real queen
you cant possibly do that said the rose i should advise you to walk the other way
this sounded nonsense to alice so she said nothing but set off at once towards the red queen
to her surprise she lost sight of her in a moment and found herself walking in at the frontdoor again
a little provoked she drew back and after looking everywhere for the queen whom she spied out at last a long way off she thought she would try the plan this time of walking in the opposite direction
it succeeded beautifully
she had not been walking a minute before she found herself face to face with the red queen and full in sight of the hill she had been so long aiming at
where do you come from
said the red queen
and where are you going
look up speak nicely and dont twiddle your fingers all the time
alice attended to all these directions and explained as well as she could that she had lost her way
i dont know what you mean by your way said the queen all the ways about here belong to mebut why did you come out here at all
she added in a kinder tone
curtsey while youre thinking what to say it saves time
alice wondered a little at this but she was too much in awe of the
queen to disbelieve it
ill try it when i go home she thought to herself the next time im a little late for dinner
its time for you to answer now the queen said looking at her watch open your mouth a little wider when you speak and always say your majesty
no i shouldnt said alice surprised into contradicting her at last a hill cant be a valley you know
that would be nonsense
the red queen shook her head you may call it nonsense if you like she said but ive heard nonsense compared with which that would be as sensible as a dictionary
alice curtseyed again as she was afraid from the queens tone that she was a little offended and they walked on in silence till they got to the top of the little hill
for some minutes alice stood without speaking looking out in all directions over the countryand a most curious country it was
i declare its marked out just like a large chessboard
alice said at last
there ought to be some men moving about somewhereand so there are
she added in a tone of delight and her heart began to beat quick with excitement as she went on
its a great huge game of chess thats being playedall over the worldif this is the world at all you know
oh what fun it is
how i wish i was one of them
i wouldnt mind being a pawn if only i might jointhough of course i should like to be a queen best
she glanced rather shyly at the real queen as she said this but her companion only smiled pleasantly and said thats easily managed
but alice felt she could not go faster though she had not breath left to say so
the most curious part of the thing was that the trees and the other things round them never changed their places at all however fast they went they never seemed to pass anything
i wonder if all the things move along with us
thought poor puzzled alice
and the queen seemed to guess her thoughts for she cried faster
dont try to talk
not that alice had any idea of doing that
she felt as if she would never be able to talk again she was getting so much out of breath and still the queen cried faster
and dragged her along
are we nearly there
alice managed to pant out at last
nearly there
the queen repeated
why we passed it ten minutes ago
and they ran on for a time in silence with the wind whistling in alices ears and almost blowing her hair off her head she fancied
cried the queen
the queen propped her up against a tree and said kindly you may rest a little now
alice looked round her in great surprise
why i do believe weve been under this tree the whole time
everythings just as it was
of course it is said the queen what would you have it
well in our country said alice still panting a little youd generally get to somewhere elseif you ran very fast for a long time as weve been doing
a slow sort of country
said the queen
now here you see it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place
if you want to get somewhere else you must run at least twice as fast as that
id rather not try please
said alice
im quite content to stay hereonly i am so hot and thirsty
i know what youd like
the queen said goodnaturedly taking a little box out of her pocket
have a biscuit
alice thought it would not be civil to say no though it wasnt at all what she wanted
so she took it and ate it as well as she could and it was very dry and she thought she had never been so nearly choked in all her life
while youre refreshing yourself said the queen ill just take the measurements
and she took a ribbon out of her pocket marked in inches and began measuring the ground and sticking little pegs in here and there
at the end of two yards she said putting in a peg to mark the distance i shall give you your directionshave another biscuit
no thank you said alice ones quite enough
thirst quenched i hope
said the queen
alice did not know what to say to this but luckily the queen did not wait for an answer but went on
at the end of three yards i shall repeat themfor fear of your forgetting them
at the end of four i shall say goodbye
and at the end of five i shall go
she had got all the pegs put in by this time and alice looked on with great interest as she returned to the tree and then began slowly walking down the row
at the twoyard peg she faced round and said a pawn goes two squares in its first move you know
so youll go very quickly through the
third squareby railway i should thinkand youll find yourself in the
fourth square in no time
well that square belongs to tweedledum and
tweedledeethe fifth is mostly waterthe sixth belongs to humpty
dumptybut you make no remark
ii didnt know i had to make onejust then alice faltered out
you should have said its extremely kind of you to tell me all thishowever well suppose it saidthe seventh square is all foresthowever one of the knights will show you the wayand in the
eighth square we shall be queens together and its all feasting and fun
alice got up and curtseyed and sat down again
at the next peg the queen turned again and this time she said speak in french when you cant think of the english for a thingturn out your toes as you walkand remember who you are
she did not wait for alice to curtsey this time but walked on quickly to the next peg where she turned for a moment to say goodbye and then hurried on to the last
how it happened alice never knew but exactly as she came to the last peg she was gone
whether she vanished into the air or whether she ran quickly into the wood and she can run very fast
alice there was no way of guessing but she was gone and alice began to remember that she was a pawn and that it would soon be time for her to move
chapter iii
lookingglass insects
of course the first thing to do was to make a grand survey of the country she was going to travel through
its something very like learning geography thought alice as she stood on tiptoe in hopes of being able to see a little further
principal riversthere are none
principal mountainsim on the only one but i dont think its got any name
principal townswhy what are those creatures making honey down there
however this was anything but a regular bee in fact it was an elephantas alice soon found out though the idea quite took her breath away at first
and what enormous flowers they must be
was her next idea
something like cottages with the roofs taken off and stalks put to themand what quantities of honey they must make
i think ill go down andno i wont just yet she went on checking herself just as she was beginning to run down the hill and trying to find some excuse for turning shy so suddenly
itll never do to go down among them without a good long branch to brush them awayand what fun itll be when they ask me how i like my walk
i shall sayoh i like it well enough here came the favourite little toss of the head only it was so dusty and hot and the elephants did tease so
i think ill go down the other way she said after a pause and perhaps i may visit the elephants later on
besides i do so want to get into the third square
so with this excuse she ran down the hill and jumped over the first of the six little brooks
tickets please
said the guard putting his head in at the window
in a moment everybody was holding out a ticket they were about the same size as the people and quite seemed to fill the carriage
show your ticket child
the guard went on looking angrily at alice
and a great many voices all said together like the chorus of a song thought alice dont keep him waiting child
why his time is worth a thousand pounds a minute
im afraid i havent got one alice said in a frightened tone there wasnt a ticketoffice where i came from
and again the chorus of voices went on
there wasnt room for one where she came from
the land there is worth a thousand pounds an inch
dont make excuses said the guard you should have bought one from the enginedriver
and once more the chorus of voices went on with the man that drives the engine
why the smoke alone is worth a thousand pounds a puff
alice thought to herself then theres no use in speaking
language is worth a thousand pounds a word
i shall dream about a thousand pounds tonight i know i shall
thought alice
all this time the guard was looking at her first through a telescope then through a microscope and then through an operaglass
at last he said youre travelling the wrong way and shut up the window and went away
so young a child said the gentleman sitting opposite to her he was dressed in white paper ought to know which way shes going even if she doesnt know her own name
a goat that was sitting next to the gentleman in white shut his eyes and said in a loud voice she ought to know her way to the ticketoffice even if she doesnt know her alphabet
alice couldnt see who was sitting beyond the beetle but a hoarse voice spoke next
change engines it said and was obliged to leave off
it sounds like a horse alice thought to herself
and an extremely small voice close to her ear said you might make a joke on thatsomething about horse and hoarse you know
then a very gentle voice in the distance said she must be labelled lass with care you know
and after that other voices went on what a number of people there are in the carriage
thought alice saying she must go by post as shes got a head on her she must be sent as a message by the telegraph she must draw the train herself the rest of the way and so on
but the gentleman dressed in white paper leaned forwards and whispered in her ear never mind what they all say my dear but take a returnticket every time the train stops
indeed i shant
alice said rather impatiently
i dont belong to this railway journey at alli was in a wood just nowand i wish i could get back there
you might make a joke on that said the little voice close to her ear something about you would if you could you know
dont tease so said alice looking about in vain to see where the voice came from if youre so anxious to have a joke made why dont you make one yourself
the little voice sighed deeply it was very unhappy evidently and
alice would have said something pitying to comfort it if it would only sigh like other people
she thought
but this was such a wonderfully small sigh that she wouldnt have heard it at all if it hadnt come quite close to her ear
the consequence of this was that it tickled her ear very much and quite took off her thoughts from the unhappiness of the poor little creature
i know you are a friend the little voice went on a dear friend and an old friend
and you wont hurt me though i am an insect
what kind of insect
alice inquired a little anxiously
what she really wanted to know was whether it could sting or not but she thought this wouldnt be quite a civil question to ask
what then you dont the little voice began when it was drowned by a shrill scream from the engine and everybody jumped up in alarm
alice among the rest
the horse who had put his head out of the window quietly drew it in and said its only a brook we have to jump over
everybody seemed satisfied with this though alice felt a little nervous at the idea of trains jumping at all
however itll take us into the fourth square thats some comfort
she said to herself
in another moment she felt the carriage rise straight up into the air and in her fright she caught at the thing nearest to her hand which happened to be the
goats beard
it certainly was a very large gnat about the size of a chicken
alice thought
still she couldnt feel nervous with it after they had been talking together so long
then you dont like all insects
the gnat went on as quietly as if nothing had happened
i like them when they can talk alice said
none of them ever talk where i come from
what sort of insects do you rejoice in where you come from
gnat inquired
i dont rejoice in insects at all alice explained because im rather afraid of themat least the large kinds
but i can tell you the names of some of them
of course they answer to their names
the gnat remarked carelessly
i never knew them to do it
whats the use of their having names the gnat said if they wont answer to them
no use to them said alice but its useful to the people who name them i suppose
if not why do things have names at all
i cant say the gnat replied
further on in the wood down there theyve got no nameshowever go on with your list of insects youre wasting time
well theres the horsefly alice began counting off the names on her fingers
all right said the gnat half way up that bush youll see a
rockinghorsefly if you look
its made entirely of wood and gets about by swinging itself from branch to branch
what does it live on
alice asked with great curiosity
sap and sawdust said the gnat
go on with the list
alice looked up at the rockinghorsefly with great interest and made up her mind that it must have been just repainted it looked so bright and sticky and then she went on
and theres the dragonfly
look on the branch above your head said the gnat and there youll find a snapdragonfly
its body is made of plumpudding its wings of hollyleaves and its head is a raisin burning in brandy
and what does it live on
frumenty and mince pie the gnat replied and it makes its nest in a
christmas box
crawling at your feet said the gnat alice drew her feet back in some alarm you may observe a breadandbutterfly
its wings are thin slices of breadandbutter its body is a crust and its head is a lump of sugar
and what does it live on
weak tea with cream in it
a new difficulty came into alices head
supposing it couldnt find any
she suggested
then it would die of course
but that must happen very often alice remarked thoughtfully
it always happens said the gnat
after this alice was silent for a minute or two pondering
the gnat amused itself meanwhile by humming round and round her head at last it settled again and remarked i suppose you dont want to lose your name
no indeed alice said a little anxiously
and yet i dont know the gnat went on in a careless tone only think how convenient it would be if you could manage to go home without it
that would never do im sure said alice the governess would never think of excusing me lessons for that
if she couldnt remember my name shed call me miss
as the servants do
well if she said miss and didnt say anything more the gnat remarked of course youd miss your lessons
thats a joke
i wish you had made it
why do you wish i had made it
alice asked
its a very bad one
but the gnat only sighed deeply while two large tears came rolling down its cheeks
you shouldnt make jokes alice said if it makes you so unhappy
she very soon came to an open field with a wood on the other side of it it looked much darker than the last wood and alice felt a little timid about going into it
however on second thoughts she made up her mind to go on for i certainly wont go back she thought to herself and this was the only way to the eighth square
this must be the wood she said thoughtfully to herself where things have no names
i wonder whatll become of my name when i go in
i shouldnt like to lose it at allbecause theyd have to give me another and it would be almost certain to be an ugly one
but then the fun would be trying to find the creature that had got my old name
thats just like the advertisements you know when people lose dogsanswers to the name of dash had on a brass collarjust fancy calling everything you met alice till one of them answered
only they wouldnt answer at all if they were wise
she was rambling on in this way when she reached the wood it looked very cool and shady
well at any rate its a great comfort she said as she stepped under the trees after being so hot to get into theinto what
she went on rather surprised at not being able to think of the word
i mean to get under theunder theunder this you know
putting her hand on the trunk of the tree
what does it call itself i wonder
i do believe its got no namewhy to be sure it hasnt
she stood silent for a minute thinking then she suddenly began again
then it really has happened after all
and now who am i
i will remember if i can
im determined to do it
but being determined didnt help much and all she could say after a great deal of puzzling was l i know it begins with l
just then a fawn came wandering by it looked at alice with its large gentle eyes but didnt seem at all frightened
alice said as she held out her hand and tried to stroke it but it only started back a little and then stood looking at her again
what do you call yourself
the fawn said at last
such a soft sweet voice it had
i wish i knew
thought poor alice
she answered rather sadly nothing just now
think again it said that wont do
alice thought but nothing came of it
please would you tell me what you call yourself
she said timidly
i think that might help a little
ill tell you if youll move a little further on the fawn said
i cant remember here
it cried out in a voice of delight and dear me
youre a human child
a sudden look of alarm came into its beautiful brown eyes and in another moment it had darted away at full speed
alice stood looking after it almost ready to cry with vexation at having lost her dear little fellowtraveller so suddenly
however i know my name now
she said thats some comfort
alicealicei wont forget it again
and now which of these fingerposts ought i to follow i wonder
it was not a very difficult question to answer as there was only one road through the wood and the two fingerposts both pointed along it
ill settle it alice said to herself when the road divides and they point different ways
but this did not seem likely to happen
she went on and on a long way but wherever the road divided there were sure to be two fingerposts pointing the same way one marked to tweedledums house and the other to the house of tweedledee
i do believe said alice at last that they live in the same house
i wonder i never thought of that beforebut i cant stay there long
ill just call and say how dyou do
and ask them the way out of the wood
if i could only get to the eighth square before it gets dark
chapter iv
tweedledum and tweedledee
they were standing under a tree each with an arm round the others neck and alice knew which was which in a moment because one of them had dum embroidered on his collar and the other dee
i suppose theyve each got tweedle round at the back of the collar she said to herself
if you think were waxworks he said you ought to pay you know
waxworks werent made to be looked at for nothing nohow
contrariwise added the one marked dee if you think were alive you ought to speak
for tweedledum said tweedledee had spoiled his nice new rattle
just then flew down a monstrous crow as black as a tarbarrel
which frightened both the heroes so they quite forgot their quarrel
i know what youre thinking about said tweedledum but it isnt so nohow
contrariwise continued tweedledee if it was so it might be and if it were so it would be but as it isnt it aint
thats logic
i was thinking alice said very politely which is the best way out of this wood its getting so dark
would you tell me please
but the little men only looked at each other and grinned
they looked so exactly like a couple of great schoolboys that alice couldnt help pointing her finger at tweedledum and saying first
tweedledum cried out briskly and shut his mouth up again with a snap
said alice passing on to tweedledee though she felt quite certain he would only shout out contrariwise
and so he did
youve been wrong
cried tweedledum
the first thing in a visit is to say how dye do
and shake hands
and here the two brothers gave each other a hug and then they held out the two hands that were free to shake hands with her
but it certainly was funny alice said afterwards when she was telling her sister the history of all this to find myself singing here we go round the mulberry bush
i dont know when i began it but somehow i felt as if id been singing it a long long time
the other two dancers were fat and very soon out of breath
four times round is enough for one dance tweedledum panted out and they left off dancing as suddenly as they had begun the music stopped at the same moment
then they let go of alices hands and stood looking at her for a minute there was a rather awkward pause as alice didnt know how to begin a conversation with people she had just been dancing with
it would never do to say how dye do
now she said to herself we seem to have got beyond that somehow
i hope youre not much tired
she said at last
and thank you very much for asking said tweedledum
so much obliged
added tweedledee
you like poetry
yees pretty wellsome poetry alice said doubtfully
would you tell me which road leads out of the wood
what shall i repeat to her
said tweedledee looking round at
tweedledum with great solemn eyes and not noticing alices question
the walrus and the carpenter is the longest tweedledum replied giving his brother an affectionate hug
tweedledee began instantly the sun was shining
here alice ventured to interrupt him
if its very long she said as politely as she could would you please tell me first which road
tweedledee smiled gently and began again the sun was shining on the sea shining with all his might
he did his very best to make the billows smooth and bright
and this was odd because it was the middle of the night
the moon was shining sulkily because she thought the sun
had got no business to be there after the day was done its very rude of him she said to come and spoil the fun
the sea was wet as wet could be the sands were dry as dry
you could not see a cloud because no cloud was in the sky
no birds were flying over head there were no birds to fly
the walrus and the carpenter were walking close at hand
they wept like anything to see such quantities of sand if this were only cleared away they said it would be grand
if seven maids with seven mops swept it for half a year
do you suppose the walrus said that they could get it clear
i doubt it said the carpenter and shed a bitter tear
o oysters come and walk with us
the walrus did beseech
a pleasant walk a pleasant talk along the briny beach
we cannot do with more than four to give a hand to each
the eldest oyster looked at him
but never a word he said
the eldest oyster winked his eye and shook his heavy head
meaning to say he did not choose to leave the oysterbed
but four young oysters hurried up all eager for the treat
their coats were brushed their faces washed their shoes were clean and neat
and this was odd because you know they hadnt any feet
four other oysters followed them and yet another four
and thick and fast they came at last and more and more and more
all hopping through the frothy waves and scrambling to the shore
the walrus and the carpenter walked on a mile or so
and then they rested on a rock conveniently low
and all the little oysters stood and waited in a row
the time has come the walrus said to talk of many things
of shoesand shipsand sealingwax of cabbagesand kings
and why the sea is boiling hot and whether pigs have wings
but wait a bit the oysters cried before we have our chat
for some of us are out of breath and all of us are fat
said the carpenter
they thanked him much for that
a loaf of bread the walrus said is what we chiefly need
pepper and vinegar besides are very good indeed
now if youre ready oysters dear we can begin to feed
but not on us
the oysters cried turning a little blue after such kindness that would be a dismal thing to do
the night is fine the walrus said do you admire the view
it was so kind of you to come
and you are very nice
the carpenter said nothing but cut us another slice
i wish you were not quite so deaf ive had to ask you twice
it seems a shame the walrus said to play them such a trick
after weve brought them out so far and made them trot so quick
the carpenter said nothing but the butters spread too thick
i weep for you the walrus said
i deeply sympathize
with sobs and tears he sorted out those of the largest size
holding his pocket handkerchief before his streaming eyes
o oysters said the carpenter
youve had a pleasant run
shall we be trotting home again
but answer came there none
and that was scarcely odd because theyd eaten every one
i like the walrus best said alice because you see he was a little sorry for the poor oysters
he ate more than the carpenter though said tweedledee
you see he held his handkerchief in front so that the carpenter couldnt count how many he took contrariwise
that was mean
alice said indignantly
then i like the carpenter bestif he didnt eat so many as the walrus
but he ate as many as he could get said tweedledum
this was a puzzler
after a pause alice began well
are there any lions or tigers about here
she asked timidly
its only the red king snoring said tweedledee
come and look at him
the brothers cried and they each took one of
alices hands and led her up to where the king was sleeping
isnt he a lovely sight
said tweedledum
alice couldnt say honestly that he was
he had a tall red nightcap on with a tassel and he was lying crumpled up into a sort of untidy heap and snoring loudfit to snore his head off
as tweedledum remarked
im afraid hell catch cold with lying on the damp grass said alice who was a very thoughtful little girl
hes dreaming now said tweedledee and what do you think hes dreaming about
alice said nobody can guess that
why about you
tweedledee exclaimed clapping his hands triumphantly
and if he left off dreaming about you where do you suppose youd be
where i am now of course said alice
tweedledee retorted contemptuously
youd be nowhere
why youre only a sort of thing in his dream
if that there king was to wake added tweedledum youd go outbang
just like a candle
i shouldnt
alice exclaimed indignantly
besides if im only a sort of thing in his dream what are you i should like to know
ditto said tweedledum
ditto ditto cried tweedledee
he shouted this so loud that alice couldnt help saying hush
youll be waking him im afraid if you make so much noise
well it no use your talking about waking him said tweedledum when youre only one of the things in his dream
you know very well youre not real
said alice and began to cry
you wont make yourself a bit realler by crying tweedledee remarked theres nothing to cry about
if i wasnt real alice saidhalflaughing through her tears it all seemed so ridiculousi shouldnt be able to cry
i hope you dont suppose those are real tears
tweedledum interrupted in a tone of great contempt
i know theyre talking nonsense alice thought to herself and its foolish to cry about it
so she brushed away her tears and went on as cheerfully as she could
at any rate id better be getting out of the wood for really its coming on very dark
do you think its going to rain
tweedledum spread a large umbrella over himself and his brother and looked up into it
no i dont think it is he said at leastnot under here
but it may rain outside
it mayif it chooses said tweedledee weve no objection
contrariwise
selfish things
thought alice and she was just going to say goodnight and leave them when tweedledum sprang out from under the umbrella and seized her by the wrist
do you see that
he said in a voice choking with passion and his eyes grew large and yellow all in a moment as he pointed with a trembling finger at a small white thing lying under the tree
its only a rattle alice said after a careful examination of the little white thing
not a rattlesnake you know she added hastily thinking that he was frightened only an old rattlequite old and broken
i knew it was
cried tweedledum beginning to stamp about wildly and tear his hair
its spoilt of course
here he looked at tweedledee who immediately sat down on the ground and tried to hide himself under the umbrella
alice laid her hand upon his arm and said in a soothing tone you neednt be so angry about an old rattle
but it isnt old
tweedledum cried in a greater fury than ever
its new i tell youi bought it yesterdaymy nice new rattle
and his voice rose to a perfect scream
all this time tweedledee was trying his best to fold up the umbrella with himself in it which was such an extraordinary thing to do that it quite took off alices attention from the angry brother
of course you agree to have a battle
tweedledum said in a calmer tone
i suppose so the other sulkily replied as he crawled out of the umbrella only she must help us to dress up you know
so the two brothers went off handinhand into the wood and returned in a minute with their arms full of thingssuch as bolsters blankets hearthrugs tablecloths dishcovers and coalscuttles
i hope youre a good hand at pinning and tying strings
tweedledum remarked
every one of these things has got to go on somehow or other
she said to herself as she arranged a bolster round the neck of tweedledee to keep his head from being cut off as he said
you know he added very gravely its one of the most serious things that can possibly happen to one in a battleto get ones head cut off
alice laughed aloud but she managed to turn it into a cough for fear of hurting his feelings
do i look very pale
said tweedledum coming up to have his helmet tied on
he called it a helmet though it certainly looked much more like a saucepan
wellyesa little alice replied gently
im very brave generally he went on in a low voice only today i happen to have a headache
and ive got a toothache
said tweedledee who had overheard the remark
im far worse off than you
then youd better not fight today said alice thinking it a good opportunity to make peace
we must have a bit of a fight but i dont care about going on long said tweedledum
whats the time now
tweedledee looked at his watch and said halfpast four
lets fight till six and then have dinner said tweedledum
very well the other said rather sadly and she can watch usonly youd better not come very close he added i generally hit everything i can seewhen i get really excited
and i hit everything within reach cried tweedledum whether i can see it or not
alice laughed
you must hit the trees pretty often i should think she said
tweedledum looked round him with a satisfied smile
i dont suppose he said therell be a tree left standing for ever so far round by the time weve finished
and all about a rattle
said alice still hoping to make them a little ashamed of fighting for such a trifle
i shouldnt have minded it so much said tweedledum if it hadnt been a new one
i wish the monstrous crow would come
thought alice
theres only one sword you know tweedledum said to his brother but you can have the umbrellaits quite as sharp
only we must begin quick
its getting as dark as it can
and darker said tweedledee
it was getting dark so suddenly that alice thought there must be a thunderstorm coming on
what a thick black cloud that is
and how fast it comes
why i do believe its got wings
its the crow
tweedledum cried out in a shrill voice of alarm and the two brothers took to their heels and were out of sight in a moment
alice ran a little way into the wood and stopped under a large tree
it can never get at me here she thought its far too large to squeeze itself in among the trees
but i wish it wouldnt flap its wings soit makes quite a hurricane in the woodheres somebodys shawl being blown away
wool and water
im very glad i happened to be in the way alice said as she helped her to put on her shawl again
so she began rather timidly am i addressing the white queen
well yes if you call that adressing the queen said
it isnt my notion of the thing at all
alice thought it would never do to have an argument at the very beginning of their conversation so she smiled and said if your
majesty will only tell me the right way to begin ill do it as well as
but i dont want it done at all
groaned the poor queen
ive been adressing myself for the last two hours
it would have been all the better as it seemed to alice if she had got some one else to dress her she was so dreadfully untidy
every single things crooked alice thought to herself and shes all over pins
may i put your shawl straight for you
she added aloud
i dont know whats the matter with it
the queen said in a melancholy voice
its out of temper i think
ive pinned it here and ive pinned it there but theres no pleasing it
it cant go straight you know if you pin it all on one side
alice said as she gently put it right for her and dear me what a state your hair is in
the brush has got entangled in it
the queen said with a sigh
and i lost the comb yesterday
alice carefully released the brush and did her best to get the hair into order
come you look rather better now
she said after altering most of the pins
but really you should have a ladys maid
im sure ill take you with pleasure
the queen said
twopence a week and jam every other day
alice couldnt help laughing as she said i dont want you to hire meand i dont care for jam
its very good jam said the queen
well i dont want any today at any rate
you couldnt have it if you did want it the queen said
the rule is jam tomorrow and jam yesterdaybut never jam today
it must come sometimes to jam today alice objected
no it cant said the queen
its jam every other day today isnt any other day you know
i dont understand you said alice
its dreadfully confusing
thats the effect of living backwards the queen said kindly it always makes one a little giddy at first living backwards
alice repeated in great astonishment
i never heard of such a thing
but theres one great advantage in it that ones memory works both ways
im sure mine only works one way alice remarked
i cant remember things before they happen
its a poor sort of memory that only works backwards the queen remarked
what sort of things do you remember best
alice ventured to ask
oh things that happened the week after next the queen replied in a careless tone
for instance now she went on sticking a large piece of plaster on her finger as she spoke theres the kings messenger
hes in prison now being punished and the trial doesnt even begin till next wednesday and of course the crime comes last of all
suppose he never commits the crime
said alice
that would be all the better wouldnt it
the queen said as she bound the plaster round her finger with a bit of ribbon
alice felt there was no denying that
of course it would be all the better she said but it wouldnt be all the better his being punished
youre wrong there at any rate said the queen were you ever punished
only for faults said alice
and you were all the better for it i know
the queen said triumphantly
yes but then i had done the things i was punished for said alice that makes all the difference
but if you hadnt done them the queen said that would have been better still better and better and better
her voice went higher with each better till it got quite to a squeak at last
alice was just beginning to say theres a mistake somewhere when the queen began screaming so loud that she had to leave the sentence unfinished
shouted the queen shaking her hand about as if she wanted to shake it off
my fingers bleeding
oh oh oh oh
her screams were so exactly like the whistle of a steamengine that
alice had to hold both her hands over her ears
what is the matter
she said as soon as there was a chance of making herself heard
have you pricked your finger
i havent pricked it yet the queen said but i soon shalloh oh oh
when do you expect to do it
alice asked feeling very much inclined to laugh
when i fasten my shawl again the poor queen groaned out the brooch will come undone directly
as she said the words the brooch flew open and the queen clutched wildly at it and tried to clasp it again
cried alice
youre holding it all crooked
and she caught at the brooch but it was too late the pin had slipped and the
queen had pricked her finger
that accounts for the bleeding you see she said to alice with a smile
now you understand the way things happen here
but why dont you scream now
alice asked holding her hands ready to put over her ears again
why ive done all the screaming already said the queen
what would be the good of having it all over again
by this time it was getting light
the crow must have flown away i think said alice im so glad its gone
i thought it was the night coming on
i wish i could manage to be glad
the queen said
only i never can remember the rule
you must be very happy living in this wood and being glad whenever you like
only it is so very lonely here
alice said in a melancholy voice and at the thought of her loneliness two large tears came rolling down her cheeks
oh dont go on like that
cried the poor queen wringing her hands in despair
consider what a great girl you are
consider what a long way youve come today
consider what oclock it is
consider anything only dont cry
alice could not help laughing at this even in the midst of her tears
can you keep from crying by considering things
thats the way its done the queen said with great decision nobody can do two things at once you know
lets consider your age to begin withhow old are you
im seven and a half exactly
you neednt say exactually the queen remarked i can believe it without that
now ill give you something to believe
im just one hundred and one five months and a day
i cant believe that
said alice
the queen said in a pitying tone
try again draw a long breath and shut your eyes
alice laughed
theres no use trying she said one cant believe impossible things
i daresay you havent had much practice said the queen
when i was your age i always did it for halfanhour a day
why sometimes ive believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast
there goes the shawl again
the brooch had come undone as she spoke and a sudden gust of wind blew the queens shawl across a little brook
the queen spread out her arms again and went flying after it and this time she succeeded in catching it for herself
ive got it
she cried in a triumphant tone
now you shall see me pin it on again all by myself
then i hope your finger is better now
alice said very politely as she crossed the little brook after the queen
oh much better
cried the queen her voice rising to a squeak as she went on
much beetter
the last word ended in a long bleat so like a sheep that alice quite started
she looked at the queen who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up in wool
alice rubbed her eyes and looked again
she couldnt make out what had happened at all
was she in a shop
and was that reallywas it really a sheep that was sitting on the other side of the counter
what is it you want to buy
the sheep said at last looking up for a moment from her knitting
i dont quite know yet alice said very gently
i should like to look all round me first if i might
you may look in front of you and on both sides if you like said the sheep but you cant look all round youunless youve got eyes at the back of your head
but these as it happened alice had not got so she contented herself with turning round looking at the shelves as she came to them
things flow about so here
and this one is the most provoking of allbut ill tell you what she added as a sudden thought struck her ill follow it up to the very top shelf of all
itll puzzle it to go through the ceiling i expect
but even this plan failed the thing went through the ceiling as quietly as possible as if it were quite used to it
are you a child or a teetotum
the sheep said as she took up another pair of needles
youll make me giddy soon if you go on turning round like that
she was now working with fourteen pairs at once and alice couldnt help looking at her in great astonishment
how can she knit with so many
the puzzled child thought to herself
she gets more and more like a porcupine every minute
can you row
the sheep asked handing her a pair of knittingneedles as she spoke
cried the sheep as she took up another pair of needles
this didnt sound like a remark that needed any answer so alice said nothing but pulled away
there was something very queer about the water she thought as every now and then the oars got fast in it and would hardly come out again
the sheep cried again taking more needles
youll be catching a crab directly
a dear little crab
thought alice
i should like that
didnt you hear me say feather
the sheep cried angrily taking up quite a bunch of needles
indeed i did said alice youve said it very oftenand very loud
please where are the crabs
in the water of course
said the sheep sticking some of the needles into her hair as her hands were full
feather i say
why do you say feather so often
alice asked at last rather vexed
im not a bird
you are said the sheep youre a little goose
there are some scented rushes
alice cried in a sudden transport of delight
there really areand such beauties
you neednt say please to me about em the sheep said without looking up from her knitting i didnt put em there and im not going to take em away
no but i meantplease may we wait and pick some
alice pleaded
if you dont mind stopping the boat for a minute
how am i to stop it
said the sheep
if you leave off rowing itll stop of itself
so the boat was left to drift down the stream as it would till it glided gently in among the waving rushes
i only hope the boat wont tipple over
she said to herself
oh what a lovely one
only i couldnt quite reach it
the prettiest are always further
what mattered it to her just then that the rushes had begun to fade and to lose all their scent and beauty from the very moment that she picked them
from poor alice it swept her straight off the seat and down among the heap of rushes
however she wasnt hurt and was soon up again the sheep went on with her knitting all the while just as if nothing had happened
that was a nice crab you caught
she remarked as alice got back into her place very much relieved to find herself still in the boat
i didnt see it said alice peeping cautiously over the side of the boat into the dark water
i wish it hadnt let goi should so like to see a little crab to take home with me
but the sheep only laughed scornfully and went on with her knitting
are there many crabs here
said alice
crabs and all sorts of things said the sheep plenty of choice only make up your mind
now what do you want to buy
alice echoed in a tone that was half astonished and half frightenedfor the oars and the boat and the river had vanished all in a moment and she was back again in the little dark shop
i should like to buy an egg please she said timidly
how do you sell them
fivepence farthing for onetwopence for two the sheep replied
then two are cheaper than one
alice said in a surprised tone taking out her purse
only you must eat them both if you buy two said the sheep
then ill have one please said alice as she put the money down on the counter
for she thought to herself they mightnt be at all nice you know
the sheep took the money and put it away in a box then she said i never put things into peoples handsthat would never doyou must get it for yourself
and so saying she went off to the other end of the shop and set the egg upright on a shelf
i wonder why it wouldnt do
thought alice as she groped her way among the tables and chairs for the shop was very dark towards the end
the egg seems to get further away the more i walk towards it
let me see is this a chair
why its got branches i declare
how very odd to find trees growing here
and actually heres a little brook
well this is the very queerest shop i ever saw
so she went on wondering more and more at every step as everything turned into a tree the moment she came up to it and she quite expected the egg to do the same
chapter vi
humpty dumpty
it cant be anybody else
she said to herself
im as certain of it as if his name were written all over his face
it might have been written a hundred times easily on that enormous face
and how exactly like an egg he is
she said aloud standing with her hands ready to catch him for she was every moment expecting him to fall
its very provoking humpty dumpty said after a long silence looking away from alice as he spoke to be called an eggvery
i said you looked like an egg sir alice gently explained
and some eggs are very pretty you know she added hoping to turn her remark into a sort of a compliment
some people said humpty dumpty looking away from her as usual have no more sense than a baby
humpty dumpty had a great fall
all the kings horses and all the kings men
couldnt put humpty dumpty in his place again
that last line is much too long for the poetry she added almost out loud forgetting that humpty dumpty would hear her
dont stand there chattering to yourself like that humpty dumpty said looking at her for the first time but tell me your name and your business
my name is alice but its a stupid enough name
humpty dumpty interrupted impatiently
what does it mean
must a name mean something
alice asked doubtfully
of course it must humpty dumpty said with a short laugh my name means the shape i amand a good handsome shape it is too
with a name like yours you might be any shape almost
why do you sit out here all alone
said alice not wishing to begin an argument
why because theres nobody with me
cried humpty dumpty
did you think i didnt know the answer to that
ask another
dont you think youd be safer down on the ground
alice went on not with any idea of making another riddle but simply in her goodnatured anxiety for the queer creature
that wall is so very narrow
what tremendously easy riddles you ask
humpty dumpty growled out
of course i dont think so
why if ever i did fall offwhich theres no chance ofbut if i did here he pursed his lips and looked so solemn and grand that alice could hardly help laughing
i did fall he went on the king has promised mewith his very own mouthtoto to send all his horses and all his men alice interrupted rather unwisely
now i declare thats too bad
humpty dumpty cried breaking into a sudden passion
youve been listening at doorsand behind treesand down chimneysor you couldnt have known it
i havent indeed
alice said very gently
its in a book
they may write such things in a book humpty dumpty said in a calmer tone
thats what you call a history of england that is
now take a good look at me
im one that has spoken to a king i am mayhap youll never see such another and to show you im not proud you may shake hands with me
and he grinned almost from ear to ear as he leant forwards and as nearly as possible fell off the wall in doing so and offered alice his hand
she watched him a little anxiously as she took it
if he smiled much more the ends of his mouth might meet behind she thought and then i dont know what would happen to his head
im afraid it would come off
yes all his horses and all his men humpty dumpty went on
theyd pick me up again in a minute they would
however this conversation is going on a little too fast lets go back to the last remark but one
im afraid i cant quite remember it alice said very politely
in that case we start fresh said humpty dumpty and its my turn to choose a subject he talks about it just as if it was a game
thought alice
so heres a question for you
how old did you say you were
alice made a short calculation and said seven years and six months
humpty dumpty exclaimed triumphantly
you never said a word like it
i though you meant how old are you
alice explained
if id meant that id have said it said humpty dumpty
alice didnt want to begin another argument so she said nothing
seven years and six months
humpty dumpty repeated thoughtfully
an uncomfortable sort of age
now if youd asked my advice id have said leave off at sevenbut its too late now
i never ask advice about growing alice said indignantly
the other inquired
alice felt even more indignant at this suggestion
i mean she said that one cant help growing older
one cant perhaps said humpty dumpty but two can
with proper assistance you might have left off at seven
what a beautiful belt youve got on
alice suddenly remarked
they had had quite enough of the subject of age she thought and if they really were to take turns in choosing subjects it was her turn now
at least she corrected herself on second thoughts a beautiful cravat i should have saidno a belt i meani beg your pardon
she added in dismay for humpty dumpty looked thoroughly offended and she began to wish she hadnt chosen that subject
if i only knew she thought to herself which was neck and which was waist
evidently humpty dumpty was very angry though he said nothing for a minute or two
when he did speak again it was in a deep growl
it is amostprovokingthing he said at last when a person doesnt know a cravat from a belt
i know its very ignorant of me alice said in so humble a tone that
humpty dumpty relented
its a cravat child and a beautiful one as you say
its a present from the white king and queen
is it really
said alice quite pleased to find that she had chosen a good subject after all
they gave it me humpty dumpty continued thoughtfully as he crossed one knee over the other and clasped his hands round it they gave it mefor an unbirthday present
i beg your pardon
alice said with a puzzled air
im not offended said humpty dumpty
i mean what is an unbirthday present
a present given when it isnt your birthday of course
alice considered a little
i like birthday presents best she said at last
you dont know what youre talking about
cried humpty dumpty
how many days are there in a year
three hundred and sixtyfive said alice
and how many birthdays have you
and if you take one from three hundred and sixtyfive what remains
three hundred and sixtyfour of course
humpty dumpty looked doubtful
id rather see that done on paper he said
alice couldnt help smiling as she took out her memorandumbook and worked the sum for him
humpty dumpty took the book and looked at it carefully
that seems to be done right he began
youre holding it upside down
alice interrupted
to be sure i was
humpty dumpty said gaily as she turned it round for him
i thought it looked a little queer
and only one for birthday presents you know
theres glory for you
i dont know what you mean by glory alice said
humpty dumpty smiled contemptuously
of course you donttill i tell you
i meant theres a nice knockdown argument for you
but glory doesnt mean a nice knockdown argument alice objected
when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to meanneither more nor less
the question is said alice whether you can make words mean so many different things
the question is said humpty dumpty which is to be masterthats all
alice was too much puzzled to say anything so after a minute humpty
dumpty began again
theyve a temper some of themparticularly verbs theyre the proudestadjectives you can do anything with but not verbshowever i can manage the whole lot of them
impenetrability
thats what i say
would you tell me please said alice what that means
now you talk like a reasonable child said humpty dumpty looking very much pleased
i meant by impenetrability that weve had enough of that subject and it would be just as well if youd mention what you mean to do next as i suppose you dont mean to stop here all the rest of your life
thats a great deal to make one word mean alice said in a thoughtful tone
when i make a word do a lot of work like that said humpty dumpty i always pay it extra
said alice
she was too much puzzled to make any other remark
ah you should see em come round me of a saturday night humpty
dumpty went on wagging his head gravely from side to side for to get their wages you know
alice didnt venture to ask what he paid them with and so you see i cant tell you
you seem very clever at explaining words sir said alice
would you kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called jabberwocky
lets hear it said humpty dumpty
i can explain all the poems that were ever inventedand a good many that havent been invented just yet
this sounded very hopeful so alice repeated the first verse twas brillig and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe
all mimsy were the borogoves and the mome raths outgrabe
thats enough to begin with humpty dumpty interrupted there are plenty of hard words there
brillig means four oclock in the afternoonthe time when you begin broiling things for dinner
thatll do very well said alice and slithy
well slithy means lithe and slimy
lithe is the same as active
you see its like a portmanteauthere are two meanings packed up into one word
i see it now alice remarked thoughtfully and what are toves
well toves are something like badgerstheyre something like lizardsand theyre something like corkscrews
they must be very curious looking creatures
they are that said humpty dumpty also they make their nests under sundialsalso they live on cheese
and whats the gyre and to gimble
to gyre is to go round and round like a gyroscope
to gimble is to make holes like a gimlet
and the wabe is the grassplot round a sundial i suppose
alice surprised at her own ingenuity
of course it is
its called wabe you know because it goes a long way before it and a long way behind it and a long way beyond it on each side alice added
exactly so
well then mimsy is flimsy and miserable theres another portmanteau for you
and a borogove is a thin shabbylooking bird with its feathers sticking out all roundsomething like a live mop
and then mome raths
said alice
im afraid im giving you a great deal of trouble
well a rath is a sort of green pig but mome im not certain about
i think its short for from homemeaning that theyd lost their way you know
and what does outgrabe mean
whos been repeating all that hard stuff to you
i read it in a book said alice
but i had some poetry repeated to me much easier than that bytweedledee i think it was
as to poetry you know said humpty dumpty stretching out one of his great hands i can repeat poetry as well as other folk if it comes to that oh it neednt come to that
alice hastily said hoping to keep him from beginning
the piece im going to repeat he went on without noticing her remark was written entirely for your amusement
alice felt that in that case she really ought to listen to it so she sat down and said thank you rather sadly
in winter when the fields are white
i sing this song for your delight only i dont sing it he added as an explanation
i see you dont said alice
if you can see whether im singing or not youve sharper eyes than most
humpty dumpty remarked severely
alice was silent
in spring when woods are getting green
ill try and tell you what i mean
thank you very much said alice
in summer when the days are long
perhaps youll understand the song
in autumn when the leaves are brown
take pen and ink and write it down
i will if i can remember it so long said alice
you neednt go on making remarks like that humpty dumpty said theyre not sensible and they put me out
i sent a message to the fish
i told them this is what i wish
the little fishes of the sea
they sent an answer back to me
the little fishes answer was we cannot do it sir because im afraid i dont quite understand said alice
it gets easier further on humpty dumpty replied
i sent to them again to say it will be better to obey
the fishes answered with a grin why what a temper you are in
i told them once i told them twice
they would not listen to advice
i took a kettle large and new
fit for the deed i had to do
my heart went hop my heart went thump
i filled the kettle at the pump
then some one came to me and said the little fishes are in bed
i said to him i said it plain then you must wake them up again
i said it very loud and clear
i went and shouted in his ear
humpty dumpty raised his voice almost to a scream as he repeated this verse and alice thought with a shudder i wouldnt have been the messenger for anything
but he was very stiff and proud
he said you neednt shout so loud
and he was very proud and stiff
he said id go and wake them if
i took a corkscrew from the shelf
i went to wake them up myself
and when i found the door was locked
i pulled and pushed and kicked and knocked
and when i found the door was shut
i tried to turn the handle but
there was a long pause
is that all
alice timidly asked
thats all said humpty dumpty
this was rather sudden alice thought but after such a very strong hint that she ought to be going she felt that it would hardly be civil to stay
so she got up and held out her hand
goodbye till we meet again
she said as cheerfully as she could
i shouldnt know you again if we did meet humpty dumpty replied in a discontented tone giving her one of his fingers to shake youre so exactly like other people
the face is what one goes by generally alice remarked in a thoughtful tone
thats just what i complain of said humpty dumpty
your face is the same as everybody hasthe two eyes so marking their places in the air with this thumb nose in the middle mouth under
its always the same
now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose for instanceor the mouth at the topthat would be some help
it wouldnt look nice alice objected
but humpty dumpty only shut his eyes and said wait till youve tried
alice waited a minute to see if he would speak again but as he never opened his eyes or took any further notice of her she said goodbye
chapter vii
the lion and the unicorn
the next moment soldiers came running through the wood at first in twos and threes then ten or twenty together and at last in such crowds that they seemed to fill the whole forest
alice got behind a tree for fear of being run over and watched them go by
then came the horses
having four feet these managed rather better than the footsoldiers but even they stumbled now and then and it seemed to be a regular rule that whenever a horse stumbled the rider fell off instantly
the confusion got worse every moment and alice was very glad to get out of the wood into an open place where she found the white king seated on the ground busily writing in his memorandumbook
ive sent them all
the king cried in a tone of delight on seeing
did you happen to meet any soldiers my dear as you came through the wood
yes i did said alice several thousand i should think
four thousand two hundred and seven thats the exact number the
king said referring to his book
i couldnt send all the horses you know because two of them are wanted in the game
and i havent sent the two messengers either
theyre both gone to the town
just look along the road and tell me if you can see either of them
i see nobody on the road said alice
i only wish i had such eyes the king remarked in a fretful tone
to be able to see nobody
and at that distance too
why its as much as i can do to see real people by this light
all this was lost on alice who was still looking intently along the road shading her eyes with one hand
i see somebody now
she exclaimed at last
but hes coming very slowlyand what curious attitudes he goes into
for the messenger kept skipping up and down and wriggling like an eel as he came along with his great hands spread out like fans on each side
not at all said the king
hes an anglosaxon messengerand those are anglosaxon attitudes
he only does them when hes happy
his name is haigha
he pronounced it so as to rhyme with mayor
i love my love with an h alice couldnt help beginning because he is happy
i hate him with an h because he is hideous
i fed him withwithwith hamsandwiches and hay
the other messengers called
i must have two you knowto come and go
one to come and one to go
i beg your pardon
said alice
it isnt respectable to beg said the king
i only meant that i didnt understand said alice
why one to come and one to go
didnt i tell you
the king repeated impatiently
i must have twoto fetch and carry
one to fetch and one to carry
at this moment the messenger arrived he was far too much out of breath to say a word and could only wave his hands about and make the most fearful faces at the poor king
you alarm me
said the king
i feel faintgive me a ham sandwich
on which the messenger to alices great amusement opened a bag that hung round his neck and handed a sandwich to the king who devoured it greedily
another sandwich
said the king
theres nothing but hay left now the messenger said peeping into the bag
hay then the king murmured in a faint whisper
alice was glad to see that it revived him a good deal
theres nothing like eating hay when youre faint he remarked to her as he munched away
i should think throwing cold water over you would be better alice suggested or some salvolatile
i didnt say there was nothing better the king replied
i said there was nothing like it
which alice did not venture to deny
who did you pass on the road
the king went on holding out his hand to the messenger for some more hay
nobody said the messenger
quite right said the king this young lady saw him too
so of course nobody walks slower than you
i do my best the messenger said in a sulky tone
im sure nobody walks much faster than i do
he cant do that said the king or else hed have been here first
however now youve got your breath you may tell us whats happened in the town
ill whisper it said the messenger putting his hands to his mouth in the shape of a trumpet and stooping so as to get close to the
alice was sorry for this as she wanted to hear the news too
however instead of whispering he simply shouted at the top of his voice theyre at it again
do you call that a whisper
cried the poor king jumping up and shaking himself
if you do such a thing again ill have you buttered
it went through and through my head like an earthquake
it would have to be a very tiny earthquake
thought alice
who are at it again
she ventured to ask
why the lion and the unicorn of course said the king
fighting for the crown
yes to be sure said the king and the best of the joke is that its my crown all the while
lets run and see them
and they trotted off alice repeating to herself as she ran the words of the old song the lion and the unicorn were fighting for the crown
the lion beat the unicorn all round the town
some gave them white bread some gave them brown
some gave them plumcake and drummed them out of town
doesthe onethat winsget the crown
she asked as well as she could for the run was putting her quite out of breath
dear me no
said the king
what an idea
would yoube good enough alice panted out after running a little further to stop a minutejust to getones breath again
im good enough the king said only im not strong enough
you see a minute goes by so fearfully quick
you might as well try to stop a bandersnatch
alice had no more breath for talking so they trotted on in silence till they came in sight of a great crowd in the middle of which the
lion and unicorn were fighting
they were in such a cloud of dust that at first alice could not make out which was which but she soon managed to distinguish the unicorn by his horn
they placed themselves close to where hatta the other messenger was standing watching the fight with a cup of tea in one hand and a piece of breadandbutter in the other
hes only just out of prison and he hadnt finished his tea when he was sent in haigha whispered to alice and they only give them oystershells in thereso you see hes very hungry and thirsty
how are you dear child
he went on putting his arm affectionately round
hattas neck
hatta looked round and nodded and went on with his bread and butter
were you happy in prison dear child
said haigha
hatta looked round once more and this time a tear or two trickled down his cheek but not a word would he say
speak cant you
haigha cried impatiently
but hatta only munched away and drank some more tea
speak wont you
cried the king
how are they getting on with the fight
hatta made a desperate effort and swallowed a large piece of breadandbutter
theyre getting on very well he said in a choking voice each of them has been down about eightyseven times
then i suppose theyll soon bring the white bread and the brown
alice ventured to remark
its waiting for em now said hatta this is a bit of it as im eating
there was a pause in the fight just then and the lion and the unicorn sat down panting while the king called out ten minutes allowed for refreshments
haigha and hatta set to work at once carrying rough trays of white and brown bread
alice took a piece to taste but it was very dry
i dont think theyll fight any more today the king said to hatta go and order the drums to begin
and hatta went bounding away like a grasshopper
for a minute or two alice stood silent watching him
suddenly she brightened up
she cried pointing eagerly
theres the
white queen running across the country
she came flying out of the wood over yonderhow fast those queens can run
theres some enemy after her no doubt the king said without even looking round
that woods full of them
but arent you going to run and help her
alice asked very much surprised at his taking it so quietly
no use no use
said the king
she runs so fearfully quick
you might as well try to catch a bandersnatch
but ill make a memorandum about her if you likeshes a dear good creature he repeated softly to himself as he opened his memorandumbook
do you spell creature with a double e
at this moment the unicorn sauntered by them with his hands in his pockets
i had the best of it this time
he said to the king just glancing at him as he passed
a littlea little the king replied rather nervously
you shouldnt have run him through with your horn you know
whatisthis
he said at last
this is a child
haigha replied eagerly coming in front of alice to introduce her and spreading out both his hands towards her in an
anglosaxon attitude
we only found it today
its as large as life and twice as natural
i always thought they were fabulous monsters
said the unicorn
is it alive
it can talk said haigha solemnly
the unicorn looked dreamily at alice and said talk child
alice could not help her lips curling up into a smile as she began do you know i always thought unicorns were fabulous monsters too
i never saw one alive before
well now that we have seen each other said the unicorn if youll believe in me ill believe in you
is that a bargain
yes if you like said alice
come fetch out the plumcake old man
the unicorn went on turning from her to the king
none of your brown bread for me
certainlycertainly
the king muttered and beckoned to haigha
open the bag
he whispered
not that onethats full of hay
haigha took a large cake out of the bag and gave it to alice to hold while he got out a dish and carvingknife
how they all came out of it
alice couldnt guess
it was just like a conjuringtrick she thought
the lion had joined them while this was going on he looked very tired and sleepy and his eyes were half shut
whats this
he said blinking lazily at alice and speaking in a deep hollow tone that sounded like the tolling of a great bell
ah what is it now
the unicorn cried eagerly
youll never guess
the lion looked at alice wearily
are you animalvegetableor mineral
he said yawning at every other word
its a fabulous monster
the unicorn cried out before alice could reply
then hand round the plumcake monster the lion said lying down and putting his chin on his paws
and sit down both of you to the king and the unicorn fair play with the cake you know
the king was evidently very uncomfortable at having to sit down between the two great creatures but there was no other place for him
what a fight we might have for the crown now
the unicorn said looking slyly up at the crown which the poor king was nearly shaking off his head he trembled so much
i should win easy said the lion
im not so sure of that said the unicorn
why i beat you all round the town you chicken
the lion replied angrily half getting up as he spoke
here the king interrupted to prevent the quarrel going on he was very nervous and his voice quite quivered
all round the town
thats a good long way
did you go by the old bridge or the marketplace
you get the best view by the old bridge
im sure i dont know the lion growled out as he lay down again
there was too much dust to see anything
what a time the monster is cutting up that cake
alice had seated herself on the bank of a little brook with the great dish on her knees and was sawing away diligently with the knife
its very provoking
she said in reply to the lion she was getting quite used to being called the monster
ive cut several slices already but they always join on again
you dont know how to manage lookingglass cakes the unicorn remarked
hand it round first and cut it afterwards
this sounded nonsense but alice very obediently got up and carried the dish round and the cake divided itself into three pieces as she did so
now cut it up said the lion as she returned to her place with the empty dish
i say this isnt fair
cried the unicorn as alice sat with the knife in her hand very much puzzled how to begin
the monster has given the lion twice as much as me
shes kept none for herself anyhow said the lion
do you like plumcake monster
but before alice could answer him the drums began
where the noise came from she couldnt make out the air seemed full of it and it rang through and through her head till she felt quite deafened
if that doesnt drum them out of town she thought to herself nothing ever will
chapter viii
its my own invention
after a while the noise seemed gradually to die away till all was dead silence and alice lifted up her head in some alarm
there was no one to be seen and her first thought was that she must have been dreaming about the lion and the unicorn and those queer anglosaxon messengers
however there was the great dish still lying at her feet on which she had tried to cut the plumcake so i wasnt dreaming after all she said to herself unlessunless were all part of the same dream
i do hope its my dream and not the red kings
i dont like belonging to another persons dream she went on in a rather complaining tone ive a great mind to go and wake him and see what happens
at this moment her thoughts were interrupted by a loud shouting of ahoy
and a knight dressed in crimson armour came galloping down upon her brandishing a great club
just as he reached her the horse stopped suddenly youre my prisoner
the knight cried as he tumbled off his horse
startled as she was alice was more frightened for him than for herself at the moment and watched him with some anxiety as he mounted again
as soon as he was comfortably in the saddle he began once more youre my but here another voice broke in ahoy
and alice looked round in some surprise for the new enemy
this time it was a white knight
he drew up at alices side and tumbled off his horse just as the red knight had done then he got on again and the two knights sat and looked at each other for some time without speaking
alice looked from one to the other in some bewilderment
shes my prisoner you know
the red knight said at last
yes but then i came and rescued her
the white knight replied
well we must fight for her then said the red knight as he took up his helmet which hung from the saddle and was something the shape of a horses head and put it on
you will observe the rules of battle of course
the white knight remarked putting on his helmet too
i always do said the red knight and they began banging away at each other with such fury that alice got behind a tree to be out of the way of the blows
i wonder now what the rules of battle are she said to herself as she watched the fight timidly peeping out from her hidingplace one
punch and judywhat a noise they make when they tumble
just like a whole set of fireirons falling into the fender
and how quiet the horses are
they let them get on and off them just as if they were tables
it was a glorious victory wasnt it
said the white knight as he came up panting
i dont know alice said doubtfully
i dont want to be anybodys prisoner
i want to be a queen
so you will when youve crossed the next brook said the white
ill see you safe to the end of the woodand then i must go back you know
thats the end of my move
thank you very much said alice
may i help you off with your helmet
it was evidently more than he could manage by himself however she managed to shake him out of it at last
now one can breathe more easily said the knight putting back his shaggy hair with both hands and turning his gentle face and large mild eyes to alice
she thought she had never seen such a strangelooking soldier in all her life
he was dressed in tin armour which seemed to fit him very badly and he had a queershaped little deal box fastened across his shoulder upsidedown and with the lid hanging open
alice looked at it with great curiosity
i see youre admiring my little box
the knight said in a friendly tone
its my own inventionto keep clothes and sandwiches in
i carry it upsidedown so that the rain cant get in
but the things can get out alice gently remarked
do you know the lids open
i didnt know it the knight said a shade of vexation passing over his face
then all the things must have fallen out
and the box is no use without them
he unfastened it as he spoke and was just going to throw it into the bushes when a sudden thought seemed to strike him and he hung it carefully on a tree
can you guess why i did that
he said to alice
alice shook her head
in hopes some bees may make a nest in itthen i should get the honey
but youve got a beehiveor something like onefastened to the saddle said alice
yes its a very good beehive the knight said in a discontented tone one of the best kind
but not a single bee has come near it yet
and the other thing is a mousetrap
i suppose the mice keep the bees outor the bees keep the mice out i dont know which
i was wondering what the mousetrap was for said alice
it isnt very likely there would be any mice on the horses back
not very likely perhaps said the knight but if they do come i dont choose to have them running all about
you see he went on after a pause its as well to be provided for everything
thats the reason the horse has all those anklets round his feet
but what are they for
alice asked in a tone of great curiosity
to guard against the bites of sharks the knight replied
its an invention of my own
and now help me on
ill go with you to the end of the woodwhats the dish for
its meant for plumcake said alice
wed better take it with us the knight said
itll come in handy if we find any plumcake
help me to get it into this bag
its rather a tight fit you see he said as they got it in a last there are so many candlesticks in the bag
and he hung it to the saddle which was already loaded with bunches of carrots and fireirons and many other things
i hope youve got your hair well fastened on
he continued as they set off
only in the usual way alice said smiling
thats hardly enough he said anxiously
you see the wind is so very strong here
its as strong as soup
have you invented a plan for keeping the hair from being blown off
alice enquired
not yet said the knight
but ive got a plan for keeping it from falling off
i should like to hear it very much
first you take an upright stick said the knight
then you make your hair creep up it like a fruittree
now the reason hair falls off is because it hangs downthings never fall upwards you know
its a plan of my own invention
you may try it if you like
whenever the horse stopped which it did very often he fell off in front and whenever it went on again which it generally did rather suddenly he fell off behind
im afraid youve not had much practice in riding she ventured to say as she was helping him up from his fifth tumble
the knight looked very much surprised and a little offended at the remark
what makes you say that
he asked as he scrambled back into the saddle keeping hold of alices hair with one hand to save himself from falling over on the other side
because people dont fall off quite so often when theyve had much practice
ive had plenty of practice the knight said very gravely plenty of practice
alice could think of nothing better to say than indeed
but she said it as heartily as she could
they went on a little way in silence after this the knight with his eyes shut muttering to himself and alice watching anxiously for the next tumble
she was quite frightened this time and said in an anxious tone as she picked him up i hope no bones are broken
none to speak of the knight said as if he didnt mind breaking two or three of them
the great art of riding as i was saying isto keep your balance properly
like this you know
he let go the bridle and stretched out both his arms to show alice what he meant and this time he fell flat on his back right under the horses feet
plenty of practice
he went on repeating all the time that alice was getting him on his feet again
plenty of practice
its too ridiculous
cried alice losing all her patience this time
you ought to have a wooden horse on wheels that you ought
does that kind go smoothly
the knight asked in a tone of great interest clasping his arms round the horses neck as he spoke just in time to save himself from tumbling off again
much more smoothly than a live horse alice said with a little scream of laughter in spite of all she could do to prevent it
ill get one the knight said thoughtfully to himself
one or twoseveral
there was a short silence after this and then the knight went on again
im a great hand at inventing things
now i daresay you noticed that last time you picked me up that i was looking rather thoughtful
you were a little grave said alice
well just then i was inventing a new way of getting over a gatewould you like to hear it
very much indeed alice said politely
ill tell you how i came to think of it said the knight
you see i said to myself the only difficulty is with the feet the head is high enough already
now first i put my head on the top of the gatethen i stand on my headthen the feet are high enough you seethen im over you see
yes i suppose youd be over when that was done alice said thoughtfully but dont you think it would be rather hard
i havent tried it yet the knight said gravely so i cant tell for certainbut im afraid it would be a little hard
he looked so vexed at the idea that alice changed the subject hastily
what a curious helmet youve got
she said cheerfully
is that your invention too
the knight looked down proudly at his helmet which hung from the saddle
yes he said but ive invented a better one than thatlike a sugar loaf
when i used to wear it if i fell off the horse it always touched the ground directly
so i had a very little way to fall you seebut there was the danger of falling into it to be sure
that happened to me onceand the worst of it was before i could get out again the other white knight came and put it on
he thought it was his own helmet
the knight looked so solemn about it that alice did not dare to laugh
im afraid you must have hurt him she said in a trembling voice being on the top of his head
i had to kick him of course the knight said very seriously
and then he took the helmet off againbut it took hours and hours to get me out
i was as fast asas lightning you know
but thats a different kind of fastness alice objected
the knight shook his head
it was all kinds of fastness with me i can assure you
he raised his hands in some excitement as he said this and instantly rolled out of the saddle and fell headlong into a deep ditch
alice ran to the side of the ditch to look for him
she was rather startled by the fall as for some time he had kept on very well and she was afraid that he really was hurt this time
however though she could see nothing but the soles of his feet she was much relieved to hear that he was talking on in his usual tone
all kinds of fastness he repeated but it was careless of him to put another mans helmet onwith the man in it too
how can you go on talking so quietly head downwards
alice asked as she dragged him out by the feet and laid him in a heap on the bank
the knight looked surprised at the question
what does it matter where my body happens to be
my mind goes on working all the same
in fact the more head downwards i am the more i keep inventing new things
now the cleverest thing of the sort that i ever did he went on after a pause was inventing a new pudding during the meatcourse
in time to have it cooked for the next course
said alice
well not the next course the knight said in a slow thoughtful tone no certainly not the next course
then it would have to be the next day
i suppose you wouldnt have two puddingcourses in one dinner
well not the next day the knight repeated as before not the next day
in fact he went on holding his head down and his voice getting lower and lower i dont believe that pudding ever was cooked
in fact i dont believe that pudding ever will be cooked
and yet it was a very clever pudding to invent
what did you mean it to be made of
alice asked hoping to cheer him up for the poor knight seemed quite lowspirited about it
it began with blotting paper the knight answered with a groan
that wouldnt be very nice im afraid not very nice alone he interrupted quite eagerly but youve no idea what a difference it makes mixing it with other thingssuch as gunpowder and sealingwax
and here i must leave you
they had just come to the end of the wood
alice could only look puzzled she was thinking of the pudding
you are sad the knight said in an anxious tone let me sing you a song to comfort you
is it very long
alice asked for she had heard a good deal of poetry that day
its long said the knight but very very beautiful
everybody that hears me sing iteither it brings the tears into their eyes or else or else what
said alice for the knight had made a sudden pause
or else it doesnt you know
the name of the song is called haddocks eyes
oh thats the name of the song is it
alice said trying to feel interested
no you dont understand the knight said looking a little vexed
thats what the name is called
the name really is the aged aged
then i ought to have said thats what the song is called
alice corrected herself
no you oughtnt thats quite another thing
the song is called ways and means but thats only what its called you know
well what is the song then
said alice who was by this time completely bewildered
i was coming to that the knight said
the song really is asitting on a gate and the tunes my own invention
of all the strange things that alice saw in her journey through the
lookingglass this was the one that she always remembered most clearly
but the tune isnt his own invention she said to herself its i give thee all i can no more
she stood and listened very attentively but no tears came into her eyes
ill tell thee everything i can theres little to relate
i saw an aged aged man asitting on a gate
who are you aged man
i said and how is it you live
and his answer trickled through my head like water through a sieve
he said i look for butterflies that sleep among the wheat
i make them into muttonpies and sell them in the street
i sell them unto men he said who sail on stormy seas
and thats the way i get my bread a trifle if you please
but i was thinking of a plan to dye ones whiskers green
and always use so large a fan that they could not be seen
so having no reply to give to what the old man said
i cried come tell me how you live
and thumped him on the head
his accents mild took up the tale he said i go my ways
and when i find a mountainrill i set it in a blaze
and thence they make a stuff they call rolands macassar oil
yet twopencehalfpenny is all they give me for my toil
but i was thinking of a way to feed oneself on batter
and so go on from day to day getting a little fatter
i shook him well from side to side until his face was blue come tell me how you live i cried and what it is you do
he said i hunt for haddocks eyes among the heather bright
and work them into waistcoatbuttons in the silent night
and these i do not sell for gold or coin of silvery shine
but for a copper halfpenny and that will purchase nine
i sometimes dig for buttered rolls or set limed twigs for crabs
i sometimes search the grassy knolls for wheels of hansomcabs
and thats the way he gave a wink by which i get my wealth
and very gladly will i drink your honours noble health
i heard him then for i had just completed my design
to keep the menai bridge from rust by boiling it in wine
i thanked him much for telling me the way he got his wealth
but chiefly for his wish that he might drink my noble health
and now if eer by chance i put my fingers into glue
or madly squeeze a righthand foot into a lefthand shoe
or if i drop upon my toe a very heavy weight
i weep for it reminds me so
of that old man i used to know
whose look was mild whose speech was slow
whose hair was whiter than the snow
whose face was very like a crow
with eyes like cinders all aglow
who seemed distracted with his woe
who rocked his body to and fro
and muttered mumblingly and low
as if his mouth were full of dough
who snorted like a buffalo
that summer evening long ago asitting on a gate
as the knight sang the last words of the ballad he gathered up the reins and turned his horses head along the road by which they had come
youve only a few yards to go he said down the hill and over that little brook and then youll be a queenbut youll stay and see me off first
he added as alice turned with an eager look in the direction to which he pointed
i shant be long
youll wait and wave your handkerchief when i get to that turn in the road
i think itll encourage me you see
of course ill wait said alice and thank you very much for coming so farand for the songi liked it very much
i hope so the knight said doubtfully but you didnt cry so much as
i thought you would
so they shook hands and then the knight rode slowly away into the forest
it wont take long to see him off i expect alice said to herself as she stood watching him
there he goes
right on his head as usual
after the fourth or fifth tumble he reached the turn and then she waved her handkerchief to him and waited till he was out of sight
i hope it encouraged him she said as she turned to run down the hill and now for the last brook and to be a queen
how grand it sounds
a very few steps brought her to the edge of the brook
eighth square at last
she cried as she bounded across and threw herself down to rest on a lawn as soft as moss with little flowerbeds dotted about it here and there
oh how glad i am to get here
and what is this on my head
she exclaimed in a tone of dismay as she put her hands up to something very heavy and fitted tight all round her head
but how can it have got there without my knowing it
she said to herself as she lifted it off and set it on her lap to make out what it could possibly be
it was a golden crown
chapter ix
queen alice well this is grand
said alice
i never expected i should be a
queen so soonand ill tell you what it is your majesty she went on in a severe tone she was always rather fond of scolding herself itll never do for you to be lolling about on the grass like that
queens have to be dignified you know
queen she said as she sat down again i shall be able to manage it quite well in time
however there would be no harm she thought in asking if the game was over
please would you tell me she began looking timidly at the red queen
speak when youre spoken to
the queen sharply interrupted her
cried the queen
why dont you see child here she broke off with a frown and after thinking for a minute suddenly changed the subject of the conversation
what do you mean by if you really are a queen
what right have you to call yourself so
you cant be a queen you know till youve passed the proper examination
and the sooner we begin it the better
i only said if
poor alice pleaded in a piteous tone
the two queens looked at each other and the red queen remarked with a little shudder she says she only said if but she said a great deal more than that
the white queen moaned wringing her hands
oh ever so much more than that
so you did you know the red queen said to alice
always speak the truththink before you speakand write it down afterwards
im sure i didnt mean alice was beginning but the red queen interrupted her impatiently
thats just what i complain of
you should have meant
what do you suppose is the use of child without any meaning
even a joke should have some meaningand a childs more important than a joke i hope
you couldnt deny that even if you tried with both hands
i dont deny things with my hands alice objected
nobody said you did said the red queen
i said you couldnt if you tried
shes in that state of mind said the white queen that she wants to deny somethingonly she doesnt know what to deny
a nasty vicious temper the red queen remarked and then there was an uncomfortable silence for a minute or two
the red queen broke the silence by saying to the white queen i invite you to alices dinnerparty this afternoon
the white queen smiled feebly and said and i invite you
i didnt know i was to have a party at all said alice but if there is to be one i think i ought to invite the guests
we gave you the opportunity of doing it the red queen remarked but
i daresay youve not had many lessons in manners yet
manners are not taught in lessons said alice
lessons teach you to do sums and things of that sort
and you do addition
the white queen asked
whats one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one
i dont know said alice
i lost count
she cant do addition the red queen interrupted
can you do
subtraction
take nine from eight
nine from eight i cant you know alice replied very readily but she cant do subtraction said the white queen
can you do division
divide a loaf by a knifewhats the answer to that
i suppose alice was beginning but the red queen answered for her
breadandbutter of course
try another subtraction sum
take a bone from a dog what remains
alice considered
the bone wouldnt remain of course if i took itand the dog wouldnt remain it would come to bite meand im sure i shouldnt remain
then you think nothing would remain
said the red queen
i think thats the answer
wrong as usual said the red queen the dogs temper would remain
but i dont see how why look here
the red queen cried
the dog would lose its temper wouldnt it
perhaps it would alice replied cautiously
then if the dog went away its temper would remain
the queen exclaimed triumphantly
alice said as gravely as she could they might go different ways
but she couldnt help thinking to herself what dreadful nonsense we are talking
she cant do sums a bit
the queens said together with great emphasis
can you do sums
alice said turning suddenly on the white queen for she didnt like being found fault with so much
the queen gasped and shut her eyes
i can do addition if you give me timebut i cant do subtraction under any circumstances
of course you know your a b c
said the red queen
to be sure i do
said alice
so do i the white queen whispered well often say it over together dear
and ill tell you a secreti can read words of one letter
isnt that grand
however dont be discouraged
youll come to it in time
here the red queen began again
can you answer useful questions
how is bread made
i know that
alice cried eagerly
you take some flour where do you pick the flower
the white queen asked
in a garden or in the hedges
well it isnt picked at all alice explained its ground how many acres of ground
said the white queen
you mustnt leave out so many things
fan her head
the red queen anxiously interrupted
shell be feverish after so much thinking
so they set to work and fanned her with bunches of leaves till she had to beg them to leave off it blew her hair about so
shes all right again now said the red queen
do you know
whats the french for fiddlededee
fiddlededees not english alice replied gravely
who ever said it was
said the red queen
alice thought she saw a way out of the difficulty this time
if youll tell me what language fiddlededee is ill tell you the french for it
she exclaimed triumphantly
but the red queen drew herself up rather stiffly and said queens never make bargains
i wish queens never asked questions alice thought to herself
dont let us quarrel the white queen said in an anxious tone
what is the cause of lightning
the cause of lightning alice said very decidedly for she felt quite certain about this is the thunderno no
she hastily corrected herself
i meant the other way
its too late to correct it said the red queen when youve once said a thing that fixes it and you must take the consequences
which reminds me the white queen said looking down and nervously clasping and unclasping her hands we had such a thunderstorm last
tuesdayi mean one of the last set of tuesdays you know
alice was puzzled
in our country she remarked theres only one day at a time
the red queen said thats a poor thin way of doing things
now here we mostly have days and nights two or three at a time and sometimes in the winter we take as many as five nights togetherfor warmth you know
are five nights warmer than one night then
alice ventured to ask
five times as warm of course
but they should be five times as cold by the same rule just so
cried the red queen
five times as warm and five times as coldjust as im five times as rich as you are and five times as clever
alice sighed and gave it up
its exactly like a riddle with no answer
she thought
humpty dumpty saw it too the white queen went on in a low voice more as if she were talking to herself
he came to the door with a corkscrew in his hand what did he want
said the red queen
he said he would come in the white queen went on because he was looking for a hippopotamus
now as it happened there wasnt such a thing in the house that morning
is there generally
alice asked in an astonished tone
well only on thursdays said the queen
i know what he came for said alice he wanted to punish the fish because
here the white queen began again
it was such a thunderstorm you cant think
she never could you know said the red queen
alice thought to herself i never should try to remember my name in the middle of an accident
where would be the use of it
but she did not say this aloud for fear of hurting the poor queens feeling
your majesty must excuse her the red queen said to alice taking one of the white queens hands in her own and gently stroking it she means well but she cant help saying foolish things as a general rule
the white queen looked timidly at alice who felt she ought to say something kind but really couldnt think of anything at the moment
she never was really well brought up the red queen went on but its amazing how goodtempered she is
pat her on the head and see how pleased shell be
but this was more than alice had courage to do
a little kindnessand putting her hair in paperswould do wonders with her
the white queen gave a deep sigh and laid her head on alices shoulder
i am so sleepy
she moaned
shes tired poor thing
said the red queen
smooth her hairlend her your nightcapand sing her a soothing lullaby
i havent got a nightcap with me said alice as she tried to obey the first direction and i dont know any soothing lullabies
i must do it myself then said the red queen and she began hushaby lady in alices lap
till the feasts ready weve time for a nap
when the feasts over well go to the ball
red queen and white queen and alice and all
and now you know the words she added as she put her head down on
alices other shoulder just sing it through to me
im getting sleepy too
in another moment both queens were fast asleep and snoring loud
what am i to do
exclaimed alice looking about in great perplexity as first one round head and then the other rolled down from her shoulder and lay like a heavy lump in her lap
i dont think it ever happened before that any one had to take care of two queens asleep at once
no not in all the history of englandit couldnt you know because there never was more than one queen at a time
do wake up you heavy things
she went on in an impatient tone but there was no answer but a gentle snoring
she was standing before an arched doorway over which were the words
queen alice in large letters and on each side of the arch there was a bellhandle one was marked visitors bell and the other servants
ill wait till the songs over thought alice and then ill ringthewhich bell must i ring
she went on very much puzzled by the names
im not a visitor and im not a servant
there ought to be one marked queen you know
just then the door opened a little way and a creature with a long beak put its head out for a moment and said no admittance till the week after next
and shut the door again with a bang
alice knocked and rang in vain for a long time but at last a very old
frog who was sitting under a tree got up and hobbled slowly towards her he was dressed in bright yellow and had enormous boots on
what is it now
the frog said in a deep hoarse whisper
alice turned round ready to find fault with anybody
wheres the servant whose business it is to answer the door
she began angrily
which door
said the frog
alice almost stamped with irritation at the slow drawl in which he spoke
this door of course
the frog looked at the door with his large dull eyes for a minute then he went nearer and rubbed it with his thumb as if he were trying whether the paint would come off then he looked at alice
to answer the door
whats it been asking of
he was so hoarse that alice could scarcely hear him
i dont know what you mean she said
i talks english doesnt i
the frog went on
or are you deaf
what did it ask you
alice said impatiently
ive been knocking at it
shouldnt do thatshouldnt do that the frog muttered
vexes it you know
then he went up and gave the door a kick with one of his great feet
you let it alone he panted out as he hobbled back to his tree and itll let you alone you know
at this moment the door was flung open and a shrill voice was heard singing to the lookingglass world it was alice that said ive a sceptre in hand ive a crown on my head
let the lookingglass creatures whatever they be
come and dine with the red queen the white queen and me
and hundreds of voices joined in the chorus then fill up the glasses as quick as you can
and sprinkle the table with buttons and bran
put cats in the coffee and mice in the tea
and welcome queen alice with thirtytimesthree
then followed a confused noise of cheering and alice thought to herself thirty times three makes ninety
i wonder if any ones counting
in a minute there was silence again and the same shrill voice sang another verse o lookingglass creatures quoth alice draw near
tis an honour to see me a favour to hear tis a privilege high to have dinner and tea
along with the red queen the white queen and me
then came the chorus again then fill up the glasses with treacle and ink
or anything else that is pleasant to drink
mix sand with the cider and wool with the wine
and welcome queen alice with ninetytimesnine
ninety times nine
alice repeated in despair oh thatll never be done
id better go in at once and there was a dead silence the moment she appeared
im glad theyve come without waiting to be asked she thought i should never have known who were the right people to invite
there were three chairs at the head of the table the red and white
queens had already taken two of them but the middle one was empty
alice sat down in it rather uncomfortable in the silence and longing for some one to speak
at last the red queen began
youve missed the soup and fish she said
put on the joint
and the waiters set a leg of mutton before
alice who looked at it rather anxiously as she had never had to carve a joint before
you look a little shy let me introduce you to that leg of mutton said the red queen
alicemutton muttonalice
the leg of mutton got up in the dish and made a little bow to alice and alice returned the bow not knowing whether to be frightened or amused
may i give you a slice
she said taking up the knife and fork and looking from one queen to the other
certainly not the red queen said very decidedly it isnt etiquette to cut any one youve been introduced to
remove the joint
and the waiters carried it off and brought a large plumpudding in its place
i wont be introduced to the pudding please alice said rather hastily or we shall get no dinner at all
may i give you some
but the red queen looked sulky and growled puddingalice
alicepudding
remove the pudding
and the waiters took it away so quickly that alice couldnt return its bow
however she didnt see why the red queen should be the only one to give orders so as an experiment she called out waiter
bring back the pudding
and there it was again in a moment like a conjuringtrick
it was so large that she couldnt help feeling a little shy with it as she had been with the mutton however she conquered her shyness by a great effort and cut a slice and handed it to the red queen
what impertinence
said the pudding
i wonder how youd like it if
i were to cut a slice out of you you creature
it spoke in a thick suety sort of voice and alice hadnt a word to say in reply she could only sit and look at it and gasp
make a remark said the red queen its ridiculous to leave all the conversation to the pudding
do you know why theyre so fond of fishes all about here
she spoke to the red queen whose answer was a little wide of the mark
as to fishes she said very slowly and solemnly putting her mouth close to alices ear her white majesty knows a lovely riddleall in poetryall about fishes
shall she repeat it
her red majestys very kind to mention it the white queen murmured into alices other ear in a voice like the cooing of a pigeon
it would be such a treat
please do alice said very politely
the white queen laughed with delight and stroked alices cheek
then she began first the fish must be caught
that is easy a baby i think could have caught it
next the fish must be bought
that is easy a penny i think would have bought it
now cook me the fish
that is easy and will not take more than a minute
let it lie in a dish
that is easy because it already is in it
bring it here
let me sup
it is easy to set such a dish on the table
take the dishcover up
ah that is so hard that i fear im unable
for it holds it like glue
holds the lid to the dish while it lies in the middle which is easiest to do
undishcover the fish or dishcover the riddle
take a minute to think about it and then guess said the red queen
meanwhile well drink your healthqueen alices health
thought alice
you ought to return thanks in a neat speech the red queen said frowning at alice as she spoke
we must support you you know the white queen whispered as alice got up to do it very obediently but a little frightened
thank you very much she whispered in reply but i can do quite well without
that wouldnt be at all the thing the red queen said very decidedly so alice tried to submit to it with a good grace
and they did push so
she said afterwards when she was telling her sister the history of the feast
you would have thought they wanted to squeeze me flat
in fact it was rather difficult for her to keep in her place while she made her speech the two queens pushed her so one on each side that they nearly lifted her up into the air i rise to return thanks
alice began and she really did rise as she spoke several inches but she got hold of the edge of the table and managed to pull herself down again
take care of yourself
screamed the white queen seizing alices hair with both her hands
somethings going to happen
and then as alice afterwards described it all sorts of things happened in a moment
the candles all grew up to the ceiling looking something like a bed of rushes with fireworks at the top
at this moment she heard a hoarse laugh at her side and turned to see what was the matter with the white queen but instead of the queen there was the leg of mutton sitting in the chair
there was not a moment to be lost
already several of the guests were lying down in the dishes and the soup ladle was walking up the table towards alices chair and beckoning to her impatiently to get out of its way
i cant stand this any longer
she cried as she jumped up and seized the tablecloth with both hands one good pull and plates dishes guests and candles came crashing down together in a heap on the floor
at any other time alice would have felt surprised at this but she was far too much excited to be surprised at anything now
as for you she repeated catching hold of the little creature in the very act of jumping over a bottle which had just lighted upon the table ill shake you into a kitten that i will
she took her off the table as she spoke and shook her backwards and forwards with all her might
chapter xi
waking and it really was a kitten after all
chapter xii
which dreamed it
your majesty shouldnt purr so loud alice said rubbing her eyes and addressing the kitten respectfully yet with some severity
you woke me out of oh
such a nice dream
and youve been along with me
kittyall through the lookingglass world
did you know it dear
it is a very inconvenient habit of kittens alice had once made the remark that whatever you say to them they always purr
if they would only purr for yes and mew for no or any rule of that sort she had said so that one could keep up a conversation
but how can you talk with a person if they always say the same thing
on this occasion the kitten only purred and it was impossible to guess whether it meant yes or no
so alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had found the
red queen then she went down on her knees on the hearthrug and put the kitten and the queen to look at each other
she cried clapping her hands triumphantly
confess that was what you turned into
sit up a little more stiffly dear
alice cried with a merry laugh
and curtsey while youre thinking what towhat to purr
it saves time remember
and she caught it up and gave it one little kiss just in honour of having been a red queen
snowdrop my pet
she went on looking over her shoulder at the white
kitten which was still patiently undergoing its toilet when will
dinah have finished with your white majesty i wonder
that must be the reason you were so untidy in my dreamdinah
do you know that youre scrubbing a white queen
really its most disrespectful of you
and what did dinah turn to i wonder
she prattled on as she settled comfortably down with one elbow in the rug and her chin in her hand to watch the kittens
tell me dinah did you turn to humpty
i think you didhowever youd better not mention it to your friends just yet for im not sure
by the way kitty if only youd been really with me in my dream there was one thing you would have enjoyedi had such a quantity of poetry said to me all about fishes
tomorrow morning you shall have a real treat
all the time youre eating your breakfast ill repeat the
walrus and the carpenter to you and then you can make believe its oysters dear
now kitty lets consider who it was that dreamed it all
this is a serious question my dear and you should not go on licking your paw like thatas if dinah hadnt washed you this morning
you see kitty it must have been either me or the red king
he was part of my dream of coursebut then i was part of his dream too
was it the red king
you were his wife my dear so you ought to knowoh kitty do help to settle it
im sure your paw can wait
but the provoking kitten only began on the other paw and pretended it hadnt heard the question
which do you think it was
a boat beneath a sunny sky
lingering onward dreamily
in an evening of july
children three that nestle near
eager eye and willing ear
pleased a simple tale to hear
long has paled that sunny sky
echoes fade and memories die
autumn frosts have slain july
still she haunts me phantomwise
alice moving under skies
never seen by waking eyes
children yet the tale to hear
eager eye and willing ear
lovingly shall nestle near
in a wonderland they lie
dreaming as the days go by
dreaming as the summers die
ever drifting down the stream
lingering in the golden gleam
life what is it but a dream
