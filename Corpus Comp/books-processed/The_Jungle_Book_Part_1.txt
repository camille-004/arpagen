mowglis brothers now rann the kite brings home the night that mang the bat sets free the herds are shut in byre and hut for loosed till dawn are we
this is the hour of pride and power talon and tush and claw
oh hear the call
good hunting all that keep the jungle law
nightsong in the jungle
it was seven oclock of a very warm evening in the seeonee hills when
father wolf woke up from his days rest scratched himself yawned and spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling in their tips
mother wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped across her four tumbling squealing cubs and the moon shone into the mouth of the cave where they all lived
said father wolf
it is time to hunt again
he was going to spring down hill when a little shadow with a bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined good luck go with you o
chief of the wolves
and good luck and strong white teeth go with noble children that they may never forget the hungry in this world
even the tiger runs and hides when little tabaqui goes mad for madness is the most disgraceful thing that can overtake a wild creature
we call it hydrophobia but they call it dewaneethe madnessand run
enter then and look said father wolf stiffly but there is no food here
for a wolf no said tabaqui but for so mean a person as myself a dry bone is a good feast
who are we the gidurlog the jackal people to pick and choose
he scuttled to the back of the cave where he found the bone of a buck with some meat on it and sat cracking the end merrily
all thanks for this good meal he said licking his lips
how beautiful are the noble children
how large are their eyes
and so young too
indeed indeed i might have remembered that the children of kings are men from the beginning
now tabaqui knew as well as anyone else that there is nothing so unlucky as to compliment children to their faces
it pleased him to see
mother and father wolf look uncomfortable
tabaqui sat still rejoicing in the mischief that he had made and then he said spitefully shere khan the big one has shifted his hunting grounds
he will hunt among these hills for the next moon so he has told me
shere khan was the tiger who lived near the waingunga river twenty miles away
he has no right
father wolf began angrilyby the law of the jungle he has no right to change his quarters without due warning
he will frighten every head of game within ten miles and ii have to kill for two these days
his mother did not call him lungri the lame one for nothing said
mother wolf quietly
he has been lame in one foot from his birth
that is why he has only killed cattle
now the villagers of the waingunga are angry with him and he has come here to make our villagers angry
they will scour the jungle for him when he is far away and we and our children must run when the grass is set alight
indeed we are very grateful to shere khan
shall i tell him of your gratitude
said tabaqui
snapped father wolf
out and hunt with thy master
thou hast done harm enough for one night
i go said tabaqui quietly
ye can hear shere khan below in the thickets
i might have saved myself the message
father wolf listened and below in the valley that ran down to a little river he heard the dry angry snarly singsong whine of a tiger who has caught nothing and does not care if all the jungle knows it
said father wolf
to begin a nights work with that noise
does he think that our buck are like his fat waingunga bullocks
it is neither bullock nor buck he hunts tonight said mother
the whine had changed to a sort of humming purr that seemed to come from every quarter of the compass
it was the noise that bewilders woodcutters and gypsies sleeping in the open and makes them run sometimes into the very mouth of the tiger
said father wolf showing all his white teeth
are there not enough beetles and frogs in the tanks that he must eat man and on our ground too
the real reason for this is that mankilling means sooner or later the arrival of white men on elephants with guns and hundreds of brown men with gongs and rockets and torches
then everybody in the jungle suffers
the reason the beasts give among themselves is that man is the weakest and most defenseless of all living things and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him
they say tooand it is truethat maneaters become mangy and lose their teeth
the purr grew louder and ended in the fullthroated aaarh
of the tigers charge
then there was a howlan untigerish howlfrom shere khan
he has missed said mother wolf
what is it
father wolf ran out a few paces and heard shere khan muttering and mumbling savagely as he tumbled about in the scrub
the fool has had no more sense than to jump at a woodcutters campfire and has burned his feet said father wolf with a grunt
tabaqui is with him
something is coming uphill said mother wolf twitching one ear
the bushes rustled a little in the thicket and father wolf dropped with his haunches under him ready for his leap
then if you had been watching you would have seen the most wonderful thing in the worldthe wolf checked in midspring
he made his bound before he saw what it was he was jumping at and then he tried to stop himself
the result was that he shot up straight into the air for four or five feet landing almost where he left ground
he snapped
a mans cub
directly in front of him holding on by a low branch stood a naked brown baby who could just walkas soft and as dimpled a little atom as ever came to a wolfs cave at night
he looked up into father wolfs face and laughed
is that a mans cub
said mother wolf
i have never seen one
bring it here
how little
how naked andhow bold
said mother wolf softly
the baby was pushing his way between the cubs to get close to the warm hide
he is taking his meal with the others
and so this is a mans cub
now was there ever a wolf that could boast of a mans cub among her children
i have heard now and again of such a thing but never in our pack or in my time said father wolf
he is altogether without hair and i could kill him with a touch of my foot
but see he looks up and is not afraid
the moonlight was blocked out of the mouth of the cave for shere khans great square head and shoulders were thrust into the entrance
tabaqui behind him was squeaking my lord my lord it went in here
shere khan does us great honor said father wolf but his eyes were very angry
what does shere khan need
a mans cub went this way said shere khan
its parents have run off
give it to me
shere khan had jumped at a woodcutters campfire as father wolf had said and was furious from the pain of his burned feet
but father wolf knew that the mouth of the cave was too narrow for a tiger to come in by
even where he was shere khans shoulders and forepaws were cramped for want of room as a mans would be if he tried to fight in a barrel
the wolves are a free people said father wolf
they take orders from the head of the pack and not from any striped cattlekiller
the mans cub is oursto kill if we choose
ye choose and ye do not choose
what talk is this of choosing
by the bull that i killed am i to stand nosing into your dogs den for my fair dues
it is i shere khan who speak
the tigers roar filled the cave with thunder
mother wolf shook herself clear of the cubs and sprang forward her eyes like two green moons in the darkness facing the blazing eyes of shere khan
and it is i raksha the demon who answers
the mans cub is mine
lungrimine to me
he shall not be killed
he shall live to run with the pack and to hunt with the pack and in the end look you hunter of little naked cubsfrogeaterfishkillerhe shall hunt thee
now get hence or by the sambhur that i killed i eat no starved cattle back thou goest to thy mother burned beast of the jungle lamer than ever thou camest into the world
father wolf looked on amazed
he had almost forgotten the days when he won mother wolf in fair fight from five other wolves when she ran in the pack and was not called the demon for compliments sake
shere khan might have faced father wolf but he could not stand up against mother
wolf for he knew that where he was she had all the advantage of the ground and would fight to the death
so he backed out of the cave mouth growling and when he was clear he shouted each dog barks in his own yard
we will see what the pack will say to this fostering of mancubs
the cub is mine and to my teeth he will come in the end o bushtailed thieves
mother wolf threw herself down panting among the cubs and father wolf said to her gravely shere khan speaks this much truth
the cub must be shown to the pack
wilt thou still keep him mother
she gasped
he came naked by night alone and very hungry yet he was not afraid
look he has pushed one of my babes to one side already
and that lame butcher would have killed him and would have run off to the waingunga while the villagers here hunted through all our lairs in revenge
assuredly i will keep him
lie still little frog
o thou mowglifor mowgli the frog i will call theethe time will come when thou wilt hunt shere khan as he has hunted thee
but what will our pack say
said father wolf
the law of the jungle lays down very clearly that any wolf may when he marries withdraw from the pack he belongs to
but as soon as his cubs are old enough to stand on their feet he must bring them to the pack
council which is generally held once a month at full moon in order that the other wolves may identify them
after that inspection the cubs are free to run where they please and until they have killed their first buck no excuse is accepted if a grown wolf of the pack kills one of them
the punishment is death where the murderer can be found and if you think for a minute you will see that this must be so
father wolf waited till his cubs could run a little and then on the night of the pack meeting took them and mowgli and mother wolf to the
council rocka hilltop covered with stones and boulders where a hundred wolves could hide
the lone wolf had led them for a year now
he had fallen twice into a wolf trap in his youth and once he had been beaten and left for dead so he knew the manners and customs of men
there was very little talking at the rock
sometimes a mother would push her cub far out into the moonlight to be sure that he had not been overlooked
akela from his rock would cry ye know the lawye know the law
look well o wolves
and the anxious mothers would take up the call looklook well o wolves
at lastand mother wolfs neck bristles lifted as the time camefather
wolf pushed mowgli the frog as they called him into the center where he sat laughing and playing with some pebbles that glistened in the moonlight
akela never raised his head from his paws but went on with the monotonous cry look well
a muffled roar came up from behind the rocksthe voice of shere khan crying the cub is mine
give him to me
what have the free people to do with a mans cub
akela never even twitched his ears
all he said was look well o wolves
what have the free people to do with the orders of any save the free people
there was a chorus of deep growls and a young wolf in his fourth year flung back shere khans question to akela what have the free people to do with a mans cub
who speaks for this cub
said akela
among the free people who speaks
there was no answer and mother wolf got ready for what she knew would be her last fight if things came to fighting
the mans cubthe mans cub
i speak for the mans cub
there is no harm in a mans cub
i have no gift of words but i speak the truth
let him run with the pack and be entered with the others
i myself will teach him
we need yet another said akela
baloo has spoken and he is our teacher for the young cubs
who speaks besides baloo
a black shadow dropped down into the circle
it was bagheera the black
panther inky black all over but with the panther markings showing up in certain lights like the pattern of watered silk
everybody knew
bagheera and nobody cared to cross his path for he was as cunning as
tabaqui as bold as the wild buffalo and as reckless as the wounded elephant
but he had a voice as soft as wild honey dripping from a tree and a skin softer than down
and the law does not say who may or may not pay that price
am i right
said the young wolves who are always hungry
the cub can be bought for a price
it is the law
knowing that i have no right to speak here i ask your leave
speak then cried twenty voices
to kill a naked cub is shame
besides he may make better sport for you when he is grown
baloo has spoken in his behalf
now to baloos word
i will add one bull and a fat one newly killed not half a mile from here if ye will accept the mans cub according to the law
is it difficult
there was a clamor of scores of voices saying what matter
he will die in the winter rains
he will scorch in the sun
what harm can a naked frog do us
let him run with the pack
where is the bull
let him be accepted
and then came akelas deep bay crying look welllook well o wolves
mowgli was still deeply interested in the pebbles and he did not notice when the wolves came and looked at him one by one
at last they all went down the hill for the dead bull and only akela bagheera baloo and
mowglis own wolves were left
shere khan roared still in the night for he was very angry that mowgli had not been handed over to him
ay roar well said bagheera under his whiskers for the time will come when this naked thing will make thee roar to another tune or i know nothing of man
it was well done said akela
men and their cubs are very wise
he may be a help in time
truly a help in time of need for none can hope to lead the pack forever said bagheera
akela said nothing
take him away he said to father wolf and train him as befits one of the free people
and that is how mowgli was entered into the seeonee wolf pack for the price of a bull and on baloos good word
now you must be content to skip ten or eleven whole years and only guess at all the wonderful life that mowgli led among the wolves because if it were written out it would fill ever so many books
he grew up with the cubs though they of course were grown wolves almost before he was a child
when he was not learning he sat out in the sun and slept and ate and went to sleep again
he took his place at the council rock too when the pack met and there he discovered that if he stared hard at any wolf the wolf would be forced to drop his eyes and so he used to stare for fun
at other times he would pick the long thorns out of the pads of his friends for wolves suffer terribly from thorns and burs in their coats
he loved better than anything else to go with bagheera into the dark warm heart of the forest to sleep all through the drowsy day and at night see how bagheera did his killing
bagheera killed right and left as he felt hungry and so did
mowgliwith one exception
as soon as he was old enough to understand things bagheera told him that he must never touch cattle because he had been bought into the pack at the price of a bulls life
that is the law of the jungle
mowgli obeyed faithfully
and he grew and grew strong as a boy must grow who does not know that he is learning any lessons and who has nothing in the world to think of except things to eat
mother wolf told him once or twice that shere khan was not a creature to be trusted and that some day he must kill shere khan
then shere khan would flatter them and wonder that such fine young hunters were content to be led by a dying wolf and a mans cub
they tell me shere khan would say that at council ye dare not look him between the eyes
and the young wolves would growl and bristle
bagheera who had eyes and ears everywhere knew something of this and once or twice he told mowgli in so many words that shere khan would kill him some day
mowgli would laugh and answer i have the pack and i have thee and baloo though he is so lazy might strike a blow or two for my sake
why should i be afraid
it was one very warm day that a new notion came to bagheeraborn of something that he had heard
as many times as there are nuts on that palm said mowgli who naturally could not count
what of it
i am sleepy bagheera and
shere khan is all long tail and loud talklike mao the peacock
but this is no time for sleeping
baloo knows it i know it the pack know it and even the foolish foolish deer know
tabaqui has told thee too
said mowgli
tabaqui came to me not long ago with some rude talk that i was a naked mans cub and not fit to dig pignuts
but i caught tabaqui by the tail and swung him twice against a palmtree to teach him better manners
that was foolishness for though tabaqui is a mischiefmaker he would have told thee of something that concerned thee closely
open those eyes little brother
shere khan dare not kill thee in the jungle
but remember akela is very old and soon the day comes when he cannot kill his buck and then he will be leader no more
many of the wolves that looked thee over when thou wast brought to the council first are old too and the young wolves believe as shere khan has taught them that a mancub has no place with the pack
in a little time thou wilt be a man
and what is a man that he should not run with his brothers
i was born in the jungle
i have obeyed the law of the jungle and there is no wolf of ours from whose paws i have not pulled a thorn
surely they are my brothers
bagheera stretched himself at full length and half shut his eyes
little brother said he feel under my jaw
mowgli put up his strong brown hand and just under bagheeras silky chin where the giant rolling muscles were all hid by the glossy hair he came upon a little bald spot
it was because of this that i paid the price for thee at the council when thou wast a little naked cub
yes i too was born among men
i had never seen the jungle
they fed me behind bars from an iron pan till one night i felt that i was bagheerathe
pantherand no mans plaything and i broke the silly lock with one blow of my paw and came away
and because i had learned the ways of men
i became more terrible in the jungle than shere khan
is it not so
yes said mowgli all the jungle fear bagheeraall except mowgli
oh thou art a mans cub said the black panther very tenderly
and even as i returned to my jungle so thou must go back to men at lastto the men who are thy brothersif thou art not killed in the council
but whybut why should any wish to kill me
said mowgli
look at me said bagheera
and mowgli looked at him steadily between the eyes
the big panther turned his head away in half a minute
that is why he said shifting his paw on the leaves
not even i can look thee between the eyes and i was born among men and i love thee
little brother
the others they hate thee because their eyes cannot meet thine because thou art wise because thou hast pulled out thorns from their feetbecause thou art a man
i did not know these things said mowgli sullenly and he frowned under his heavy black eyebrows
what is the law of the jungle
strike first and then give tongue
by thy very carelessness they know that thou art a man
but be wise
it is in my heart that when akela misses his next killand at each hunt it costs him more to pin the buckthe pack will turn against him and against thee
they will hold a jungle council at the rock and thenand theni have it
said bagheera leaping up
get the red
by red flower bagheera meant fire only no creature in the jungle will call fire by its proper name
every beast lives in deadly fear of it and invents a hundred ways of describing it
the red flower
said mowgli
that grows outside their huts in the twilight
i will get some
there speaks the mans cub said bagheera proudly
remember that it grows in little pots
get one swiftly and keep it by thee for time of need
said mowgli
but art thou sure o my bagheerahe slipped his arm around the splendid neck and looked deep into the big eyesart thou sure that all this is shere khans doing
by the broken lock that freed me i am sure little brother
then by the bull that bought me i will pay shere khan full tale for this and it may be a little over said mowgli and he bounded away
that is a man
that is all a man said bagheera to himself lying down again
oh shere khan never was a blacker hunting than that froghunt of thine ten years ago
mowgli was far and far through the forest running hard and his heart was hot in him
he came to the cave as the evening mist rose and drew breath and looked down the valley
the cubs were out but mother
wolf at the back of the cave knew by his breathing that something was troubling her frog
what is it son
some bats chatter of shere khan he called back
i hunt among the plowed fields tonight and he plunged downward through the bushes to the stream at the bottom of the valley
there he checked for he heard the yell of the pack hunting heard the bellow of a hunted sambhur and the snort as the buck turned at bay
then there were wicked bitter howls from the young wolves akela
let the lone wolf show his strength
room for the leader of the pack
spring akela
the lone wolf must have sprung and missed his hold for mowgli heard the snap of his teeth and then a yelp as the sambhur knocked him over with his forefoot
he did not wait for anything more but dashed on and the yells grew fainter behind him as he ran into the croplands where the villagers lived
bagheera spoke truth he panted as he nestled down in some cattle fodder by the window of a hut
tomorrow is one day both for akela and for me
then he pressed his face close to the window and watched the fire on the hearth
he saw the husbandmans wife get up and feed it in the night with black lumps
is that all
said mowgli
if a cub can do it there is nothing to fear
so he strode round the corner and met the boy took the pot from his hand and disappeared into the mist while the boy howled with fear
they are very like me said mowgli blowing into the pot as he had seen the woman do
this thing will die if i do not give it things to eat and he dropped twigs and dried bark on the red stuff
halfway up the hill he met bagheera with the morning dew shining like moonstones on his coat
akela has missed said the panther
they would have killed him last night but they needed thee also
they were looking for thee on the hill
i was among the plowed lands
i am ready
mowgli held up the firepot
now i have seen men thrust a dry branch into that stuff and presently the red flower blossomed at the end of it
art thou not afraid
why should i fear
i remember nowif it is not a dreamhow before i was a wolf i lay beside the red flower and it was warm and pleasant
all that day mowgli sat in the cave tending his fire pot and dipping dry branches into it to see how they looked
he found a branch that satisfied him and in the evening when tabaqui came to the cave and told him rudely enough that he was wanted at the council rock he laughed till tabaqui ran away
then mowgli went to the council still laughing
akela the lone wolf lay by the side of his rock as a sign that the leadership of the pack was open and shere khan with his following of scrapfed wolves walked to and fro openly being flattered
bagheera lay close to mowgli and the fire pot was between mowglis knees
when they were all gathered together shere khan began to speaka thing he would never have dared to do when akela was in his prime
he has no right whispered bagheera
he is a dogs son
he will be frightened
mowgli sprang to his feet
free people he cried does shere khan lead the pack
what has a tiger to do with our leadership
seeing that the leadership is yet open and being asked to speak shere khan began
said mowgli
are we all jackals to fawn on this cattle butcher
the leadership of the pack is with the pack alone
there were yells of silence thou mans cub
let him speak
he has kept our law and at last the seniors of the pack thundered let the
dead wolf speak
when a leader of the pack has missed his kill he is called the dead wolf as long as he lives which is not long
akela raised his old head wearily free people and ye too jackals of shere khan for twelve seasons i have led ye to and from the kill and in all that time not one has been trapped or maimed
now i have missed my kill
ye know how that plot was made
ye know how ye brought me up to an untried buck to make my weakness known
it was cleverly done
your right is to kill me here on the council rock now
therefore i ask who comes to make an end of the
for it is my right by the law of the jungle that ye come one by one
there was a long hush for no single wolf cared to fight akela to the death
then shere khan roared bah
what have we to do with this toothless fool
he is doomed to die
it is the mancub who has lived too long
free people he was my meat from the first
give him to me
i am weary of this manwolf folly
he has troubled the jungle for ten seasons
give me the mancub or i will hunt here always and not give you one bone
he is a man a mans child and from the marrow of my bones i hate him
then more than half the pack yelled a man
what has a man to do with us
let him go to his own place
and turn all the people of the villages against us
clamored shere
no give him to me
he is a man and none of us can look him between the eyes
akela lifted his head again and said he has eaten our food
he has slept with us
he has driven game for us
he has broken no word of the
law of the jungle
also i paid for him with a bull when he was accepted
the worth of a bull is little but bagheeras honor is something that he will perhaps fight for said bagheera in his gentlest voice
a bull paid ten years ago
the pack snarled
what do we care for bones ten years old
or for a pledge
said bagheera his white teeth bared under his lip
well are ye called the free people
no mans cub can run with the people of the jungle howled shere khan
give him to me
he is our brother in all but blood akela went on and ye would kill him here
in truth i have lived too long
some of ye are eaters of cattle and of others i have heard that under shere khans teaching ye go by dark night and snatch children from the villagers doorstep
therefore i know ye to be cowards and it is to cowards i speak
it is certain that i must die and my life is of no worth or i would offer that in the mancubs place
i will die without fighting
that will at least save the pack three lives
more i cannot do but if ye will i can save ye the shame that comes of killing a brother against whom there is no faulta brother spoken for and bought into the pack according to the law of the jungle
he is a mana mana man
snarled the pack
and most of the wolves began to gather round shere khan whose tail was beginning to switch
now the business is in thy hands said bagheera to mowgli
we can do no more except fight
mowgli stood uprightthe fire pot in his hands
then he stretched out his arms and yawned in the face of the council but he was furious with rage and sorrow for wolflike the wolves had never told him how they hated him
listen you
there is no need for this dogs jabber
ye have told me so often tonight that i am a man and indeed i would have been a wolf with you to my lifes end that i feel your words are true
so i do not call ye my brothers any more but sag dogs as a man should
what ye will do and what ye will not do is not yours to say
that matter is with me and that we may see the matter more plainly i the man have brought here a little of the red flower which ye dogs fear
he flung the fire pot on the ground and some of the red coals lit a tuft of dried moss that flared up as all the council drew back in terror before the leaping flames
mowgli thrust his dead branch into the fire till the twigs lit and crackled and whirled it above his head among the cowering wolves
thou art the master said bagheera in an undertone
save akela from the death
he was ever thy friend
said mowgli staring round slowly
i see that ye are dogs
i go from you to my own peopleif they be my own people
the jungle is shut to me and i must forget your talk and your companionship
but i will be more merciful than ye are
because i was all but your brother in blood
i promise that when i am a man among men i will not betray ye to men as ye have betrayed me
he kicked the fire with his foot and the sparks flew up
there shall be no war between any of us in the pack
but here is a debt to pay before i go
he strode forward to where shere khan sat blinking stupidly at the flames and caught him by the tuft on his chin
bagheera followed in case of accidents
mowgli cried
up when a man speaks or i will set that coat ablaze
shere khans ears lay flat back on his head and he shut his eyes for the blazing branch was very near
this cattlekiller said he would kill me in the council because he had not killed me when i was a cub
thus and thus then do we beat dogs when we are men
stir a whisker lungri and i ram the red flower down thy gullet
he beat shere khan over the head with the branch and the tiger whimpered and whined in an agony of fear
singed jungle catgo now
but remember when next i come to the
council rock as a man should come it will be with shere khans hide on my head
for the rest akela goes free to live as he pleases
ye will not kill him because that is not my will
nor do i think that ye will sit here any longer lolling out your tongues as though ye were somebodies instead of dogs whom i drive outthus
the fire was burning furiously at the end of the branch and mowgli struck right and left round the circle and the wolves ran howling with the sparks burning their fur
at last there were only akela bagheera and perhaps ten wolves that had taken mowglis part
then something began to hurt
mowgli inside him as he had never been hurt in his life before and he caught his breath and sobbed and the tears ran down his face
what is it
what is it
i do not wish to leave the jungle and i do not know what this is
am i dying bagheera
no little brother
that is only tears such as men use said bagheera
now i know thou art a man and a mans cub no longer
the jungle is shut indeed to thee henceforward
let them fall mowgli
they are only tears
so mowgli sat and cried as though his heart would break and he had never cried in all his life before
now he said i will go to men
but first i must say farewell to my mother
and he went to the cave where she lived with father wolf and he cried on her coat while the four cubs howled miserably
ye will not forget me
said mowgli
never while we can follow a trail said the cubs
come to the foot of the hill when thou art a man and we will talk to thee and we will come into the croplands to play with thee by night
said father wolf
oh wise little frog come again soon for we be old thy mother and i
come soon said mother wolf little naked son of mine
for listen child of man i loved thee more than ever i loved my cubs
i will surely come said mowgli
and when i come it will be to lay out shere khans hide upon the council rock
do not forget me
tell them in the jungle never to forget me
the dawn was beginning to break when mowgli went down the hillside alone to meet those mysterious things that are called men
huntingsong of the seeonee pack as the dawn was breaking the sambhur belled once twice and again
and a doe leaped up and a doe leaped up from the pond in the wood where the wild deer sup
this i scouting alone beheld once twice and again
as the dawn was breaking the sambhur belled once twice and again
and a wolf stole back and a wolf stole back to carry the word to the waiting pack and we sought and we found and we bayed on his track once twice and again
as the dawn was breaking the wolf pack yelled once twice and again
feet in the jungle that leave no mark
eyes that can see in the darkthe dark
tonguegive tongue to it
once twice and again
kaas hunting his spots are the joy of the leopard his horns are the buffalos pride
be clean for the strength of the hunter is known by the gloss of his hide
if ye find that the bullock can toss you or the heavybrowed sambhur can gore ye need not stop work to inform us we knew it ten seasons before
oppress not the cubs of the stranger but hail them as sister and brother for though they are little and fubsy it may be the bear is their mother
there is none like to me
says the cub in the pride of his earliest kill but the jungle is large and the cub he is small
let him think and be still
maxims of baloo
all that is told here happened some time before mowgli was turned out of the seeonee wolf pack or revenged himself on shere khan the tiger
it was in the days when baloo was teaching him the law of the jungle
jackal and the hyaena whom we hate
but mowgli as a mancub had to learn a great deal more than this
sometimes bagheera the black panther would come lounging through the jungle to see how his pet was getting on and would purr with his head against a tree while mowgli recited the days lesson to baloo
the boy could climb almost as well as he could swim and swim almost as well as he could run
bat when he disturbed him in the branches at midday and how to warn the watersnakes in the pools before he splashed down among them
none of the jungle people like being disturbed and all are very ready to fly at an intruder
then too mowgli was taught the strangers hunting call which must be repeated aloud till it is answered whenever one of the
junglepeople hunts outside his own grounds
it means translated give me leave to hunt here because i am hungry
and the answer is hunt then for food but not for pleasure
all this will show you how much mowgli had to learn by heart and he grew very tired of saying the same thing over a hundred times
baloo said to bagheera one day when mowgli had been cuffed and run off in a temper a mans cub is a mans cub and he must learn all the law of the jungle
but think how small he is said the black panther who would have spoiled mowgli if he had had his own way
how can his little head carry all thy long talk
is there anything in the jungle too little to be killed
that is why i teach him these things and that is why i hit him very softly when he forgets
what dost thou know of softness old ironfeet
bagheera grunted
his face is all bruised today by thysoftness
better he should be bruised from head to foot by me who love him than that he should come to harm through ignorance baloo answered very earnestly
i am now teaching him the master words of the jungle that shall protect him with the birds and the snake people and all that hunt on four feet except his own pack
he can now claim protection if he will only remember the words from all in the jungle
is not that worth a little beating
well look to it then that thou dost not kill the mancub
he is no tree trunk to sharpen thy blunt claws upon
but what are those master
i am more likely to give help than to ask itbagheera stretched out one paw and admired the steelblue rippingchisel talons at the end of itstill i should like to know
i will call mowgli and he shall say themif he will
come little
that is all one to me said baloo though he was hurt and grieved
tell bagheera then the master words of the jungle that i have taught thee this day
master words for which people
said mowgli delighted to show off
the jungle has many tongues
i know them all
a little thou knowest but not much
see o bagheera they never thank their teacher
not one small wolfling has ever come back to thank old baloo for his teachings
say the word for the huntingpeople thengreat scholar
we be of one blood ye and i said mowgli giving the words the bear accent which all the hunting people use
now for the birds
mowgli repeated with the kites whistle at the end of the sentence
now for the snakepeople said bagheera
therethere
that was worth a little bruise said the brown bear tenderly
some day thou wilt remember me
then he turned aside to tell bagheera how he had begged the master words from hathi the wild
elephant who knows all about these things and how hathi had taken
mowgli down to a pool to get the snake word from a watersnake because
baloo could not pronounce it and how mowgli was now reasonably safe against all accidents in the jungle because neither snake bird nor beast would hurt him
no one then is to be feared baloo wound up patting his big furry stomach with pride
except his own tribe said bagheera under his breath and then aloud to mowgli have a care for my ribs little brother
what is all this dancing up and down
mowgli had been trying to make himself heard by pulling at bagheeras shoulder fur and kicking hard
when the two listened to him he was shouting at the top of his voice and so i shall have a tribe of my own and lead them through the branches all day long
what is this new folly little dreamer of dreams
said bagheera
yes and throw branches and dirt at old baloo mowgli went on
they have promised me this
baloos big paw scooped mowgli off bagheeras back and as the boy lay between the big forepaws he could see the bear was angry
mowgli said baloo thou hast been talking with the bandarlogthe
monkey people
mowgli looked at bagheera to see if the panther was angry too and
bagheeras eyes were as hard as jade stones
thou hast been with the monkey peoplethe gray apesthe people without a lawthe eaters of everything
that is great shame
when baloo hurt my head said mowgli he was still on his back i went away and the gray apes came down from the trees and had pity on me
no one else cared
he snuffled a little
the pity of the monkey people
baloo snorted
the stillness of the mountain stream
the cool of the summer sun
and then mancub
and then and then they gave me nuts and pleasant things to eat and theythey carried me in their arms up to the top of the trees and said
i was their blood brother except that i had no tail and should be their leader some day
they have no leader said bagheera
they have always lied
they were very kind and bade me come again
why have i never been taken among the monkey people
they stand on their feet as i do
they do not hit me with their hard paws
they play all day
let me get up
baloo let me up
i will play with them again
listen mancub said the bear and his voice rumbled like thunder on a hot night
i have taught thee all the law of the jungle for all the peoples of the jungleexcept the monkeyfolk who live in the trees
they have no law
they are outcasts
they have no speech of their own but use the stolen words which they overhear when they listen and peep and wait up above in the branches
their way is not our way
they are without leaders
they have no remembrance
they boast and chatter and pretend that they are a great people about to do great affairs in the jungle but the falling of a nut turns their minds to laughter and all is forgotten
we of the jungle have no dealings with them
we do not drink where the monkeys drink we do not go where the monkeys go we do not hunt where they hunt we do not die where they die
hast thou ever heard me speak of the bandarlog till today
no said mowgli in a whisper for the forest was very still now baloo had finished
the junglepeople put them out of their mouths and out of their minds
they are very many evil dirty shameless and they desire if they have any fixed desire to be noticed by the jungle people
but we do not notice them even when they throw nuts and filth on our heads
he had hardly spoken when a shower of nuts and twigs spattered down through the branches and they could hear coughings and howlings and angry jumpings high up in the air among the thin branches
the monkeypeople are forbidden said baloo forbidden to the
junglepeople
forbidden said bagheera but i still think baloo should have warned thee against them
how was i to guess he would play with such dirt
the monkey
a fresh shower came down on their heads and the two trotted away taking
mowgli with them
what baloo had said about the monkeys was perfectly true
they belonged to the treetops and as beasts very seldom look up there was no occasion for the monkeys and the junglepeople to cross each others path
but whenever they found a sick wolf or a wounded tiger or bear the monkeys would torment him and would throw sticks and nuts at any beast for fun and in the hope of being noticed
junglepeople could see them
of course mowgli as a woodcutters child inherited all sorts of instincts and used to make little huts of fallen branches without thinking how he came to do it
the monkeypeople watching in the trees considered his play most wonderful
this time they said they were really going to have a leader and become the wisest people in the jungleso wise that everyone else would notice and envy them
the bandarlog howled with triumph and scuffled away to the upper branches where bagheera dared not follow shouting he has noticed us
bagheera has noticed us
all the junglepeople admire us for our skill and our cunning
then they began their flight and the flight of the monkeypeople through treeland is one of the things nobody can describe
they have their regular roads and crossroads up hills and down hills all laid out from fifty to seventy or a hundred feet above ground and by these they can travel even at night if necessary
two of the strongest monkeys caught mowgli under the arms and swung off with him through the treetops twenty feet at a bound
had they been alone they could have gone twice as fast but the boys weight held them back
so bounding and crashing and whooping and yelling the whole tribe of bandarlog swept along the treeroads with mowgli their prisoner
for a time he was afraid of being dropped
then he grew angry but knew better than to struggle and then he began to think
the first thing was to send back word to baloo and bagheera for at the pace the monkeys were going he knew his friends would be left far behind
rann saw that the monkeys were carrying something and dropped a few hundred yards to find out whether their load was good to eat
he whistled with surprise when he saw mowgli being dragged up to a treetop and heard him give the kite call forwe be of one blood thou and i
the waves of the branches closed over the boy but rann balanced away to the next tree in time to see the little brown face come up again
mark my trail
mowgli shouted
tell baloo of the seeonee pack and bagheera of the council rock
in whose name brother
rann had never seen mowgli before though of course he had heard of him
mowgli the frog
mancub they call me
mark my trail
the last words were shrieked as he was being swung through the air but
rann nodded and rose up till he looked no bigger than a speck of dust and there he hung watching with his telescope eyes the swaying of the treetops as mowglis escort whirled along
they never go far he said with a chuckle
they never do what they set out to do
always pecking at new things are the bandarlog
this time if i have any eyesight they have pecked down trouble for themselves for baloo is no fledgling and bagheera can as i know kill more than goats
so he rocked on his wings his feet gathered up under him and waited
meantime baloo and bagheera were furious with rage and grief
bagheera climbed as he had never climbed before but the thin branches broke beneath his weight and he slipped down his claws full of bark
why didst thou not warn the mancub
he roared to poor baloo who had set off at a clumsy trot in the hope of overtaking the monkeys
what was the use of half slaying him with blows if thou didst not warn him
wewe may catch them yet
baloo panted
at that speed
it would not tire a wounded cow
teacher of the
lawcubbeatera mile of that rolling to and fro would burst thee open
sit still and think
make a plan
this is no time for chasing
they may drop him if we follow too close
they may have dropped him already being tired of carrying him
who can trust the bandarlog
put dead bats on my head
give me black bones to eat
roll me into the hives of the wild bees that i may be stung to death and bury me with the hyaena for i am most miserable of bears
o mowgli mowgli
why did i not warn thee against the monkeyfolk instead of breaking thy head
now perhaps i may have knocked the days lesson out of his mind and he will be alone in the jungle without the master words
baloo clasped his paws over his ears and rolled to and fro moaning
at least he gave me all the words correctly a little time ago said
bagheera impatiently
baloo thou hast neither memory nor respect
what would the jungle think if i the black panther curled myself up like
ikki the porcupine and howled
what do i care what the jungle thinks
he may be dead by now
unless and until they drop him from the branches in sport or kill him out of idleness i have no fear for the mancub
he is wise and well taught and above all he has the eyes that make the junglepeople afraid
but and it is a great evil he is in the power of the
bandarlog and they because they live in trees have no fear of any of our people
bagheera licked one forepaw thoughtfully
fool that i am
oh fat brown rootdigging fool that i am said
baloo uncoiling himself with a jerk it is true what hathi the wild
elephant says to each his own fear and they the bandarlog fear
kaa the rock snake
he can climb as well as they can
he steals the young monkeys in the night
the whisper of his name makes their wicked tails cold
let us go to kaa
what will he do for us
he is not of our tribe being footlessand with most evil eyes said bagheera
he is very old and very cunning
above all he is always hungry said
baloo hopefully
promise him many goats
he sleeps for a full month after he has once eaten
he may be asleep now and even were he awake what if he would rather kill his own goats
bagheera who did not know much about kaa was naturally suspicious
then in that case thou and i together old hunter might make him see reason
here baloo rubbed his faded brown shoulder against the panther and they went off to look for kaa the rock python
he has not eaten said baloo with a grunt of relief as soon as he saw the beautifully mottled brown and yellow jacket
be careful
he is always a little blind after he has changed his skin and very quick to strike
kaa was not a poison snakein fact he rather despised the poison snakes as cowardsbut his strength lay in his hug and when he had once lapped his huge coils round anybody there was no more to be said
good hunting
cried baloo sitting up on his haunches
like all snakes of his breed kaa was rather deaf and did not hear the call at first
then he curled up ready for any accident his head lowered
good hunting for us all he answered
oho baloo what dost thou do here
good hunting bagheera
one of us at least needs food
is there any news of game afoot
a doe now or even a young buck
i am as empty as a dried well
we are hunting said baloo carelessly
he knew that you must not hurry
he is too big
give me permission to come with you said kaa
a blow more or less is nothing to thee bagheera or baloo but ii have to wait and wait for days in a woodpath and climb half a night on the mere chance of a young ape
the branches are not what they were when i was young
rotten twigs and dry boughs are they all
maybe thy great weight has something to do with the matter said
i am a fair lengtha fair length said kaa with a little pride
but for all that it is the fault of this newgrown timber
i came very near to falling on my last huntvery near indeedand the noise of my slipping for my tail was not tight wrapped around the tree waked the
bandarlog and they called me most evil names
footless yellow earthworm said bagheera under his whiskers as though he were trying to remember something
have they ever called me that
something of that kind it was that they shouted to us last moon but we never noticed them
now a snake especially a wary old python like kaa very seldom shows that he is angry but baloo and bagheera could see the big swallowing muscles on either side of kaas throat ripple and bulge
the bandarlog have shifted their grounds he said quietly
when i came up into the sun today i heard them whooping among the treetops
beyond doubt then it is no small thing that takes two such huntersleaders in their own jungle i am certainon the trail of the
bandarlog kaa replied courteously as he swelled with curiosity
the trouble is this kaa
those nutstealers and pickers of palm leaves have stolen away our mancub of whom thou hast perhaps heard
i heard some news from ikki his quills make him presumptuous of a manthing that was entered into a wolf pack but i did not believe
ikki is full of stories half heard and very badly told
but it is true
he is such a mancub as never was said baloo
the best and wisest and boldest of mancubsmy own pupil who shall make the name of baloo famous through all the jungles and besides
iwelove him kaa
said kaa weaving his head to and fro
i also have known what love is
there are tales i could tell that that need a clear night when we are all well fed to praise properly said bagheera quickly
our mancub is in the hands of the bandarlog now and we know that of all the junglepeople they fear kaa alone
they fear me alone
they have good reason said kaa
chattering foolish vainvain foolish and chattering are the monkeys
but a manthing in their hands is in no good luck
they grow tired of the nuts they pick and throw them down
they carry a branch half a day meaning to do great things with it and then they snap it in two
that manthing is not to be envied
they called me alsoyellow fish was it not
wormwormearthworm said bagheera as well as other things which
i cannot now say for shame
we must remind them to speak well of their master
we must help their wandering memories
now whither went they with the cub
the jungle alone knows
toward the sunset i believe said baloo
we had thought that thou wouldst know kaa
i take them when they come in my way but i do not hunt the
bandarlog or frogsor green scum on a waterhole for that matter
illo look up baloo of the seeonee wolf
baloo looked up to see where the voice came from and there was rann the
kite sweeping down with the sun shining on the upturned flanges of his wings
it was near ranns bedtime but he had ranged all over the jungle looking for the bear and had missed him in the thick foliage
what is it
said baloo
i have seen mowgli among the bandarlog
he bade me tell you
the bandarlog have taken him beyond the river to the monkey cityto the cold lairs
they may stay there for a night or ten nights or an hour
i have told the bats to watch through the dark time
that is my message
good hunting all you below
full gorge and a deep sleep to you rann cried bagheera
i will remember thee in my next kill and put aside the head for thee alone o best of kites
it is nothing
it is nothing
the boy held the master word
i could have done no less and rann circled up again to his roost
he has not forgotten to use his tongue said baloo with a chuckle of pride
to think of one so young remembering the master word for the birds too while he was being pulled across trees
it was most firmly driven into him said bagheera
but i am proud of him and now we must go to the cold lairs
the wild boar will but the hunting tribes do not
it is half a nights journeyat full speed said bagheera and baloo looked very serious
i will go as fast as i can he said anxiously
we dare not wait for thee
follow baloo
we must go on the quickfootkaa and i
feet or no feet i can keep abreast of all thy four said kaa shortly
baloo made one effort to hurry but had to sit down panting and so they left him to come on later while bagheera hurried forward at the quick panthercanter
kaa said nothing but strive as bagheera might the huge rockpython held level with him
when they came to a hill stream
bagheera gained because he bounded across while kaa swam his head and two feet of his neck clearing the water but on level ground kaa made up the distance
by the broken lock that freed me said bagheera when twilight had fallen thou art no slow goer
i am hungry said kaa
besides they called me speckled frog
wormearthworm and yellow to boot
let us go on and kaa seemed to pour himself along the ground finding the shortest road with his steady eyes and keeping to it
in the cold lairs the monkeypeople were not thinking of mowglis friends at all
they had brought the boy to the lost city and were very much pleased with themselves for the time
mowgli had never seen an
indian city before and though this was almost a heap of ruins it seemed very wonderful and splendid
some king had built it long ago on a little hill
you could still trace the stone causeways that led up to the ruined gates where the last splinters of wood hung to the worn rusted hinges
trees had grown into and out of the walls the battlements were tumbled down and decayed and wild creepers hung out of the windows of the towers on the walls in bushy hanging clumps
the monkeys called the place their city and pretended to despise the junglepeople because they lived in the forest
and yet they never knew what the buildings were made for nor how to use them
then all would begin again till they grew tired of the city and went back to the treetops hoping the junglepeople would notice them
mowgli who had been trained under the law of the jungle did not like or understand this kind of life
the monkeys dragged him into the cold
lairs late in the afternoon and instead of going to sleep as mowgli would have done after a long journey they joined hands and danced about and sang their foolish songs
i wish to eat said mowgli
i am a stranger in this part of the jungle
bring me food or give me leave to hunt here
twenty or thirty monkeys bounded away to bring him nuts and wild pawpaws
but they fell to fighting on the road and it was too much trouble to go back with what was left of the fruit
mowgli was sore and angry as well as hungry and he roamed through the empty city giving the
strangers hunting call from time to time but no one answered him and
mowgli felt that he had reached a very bad place indeed
all that baloo has said about the bandarlog is true he thought to himself
they have no law no hunting call and no leadersnothing but foolish words and little picking thievish hands
so if i am starved or killed here it will be all my own fault
but i must try to return to my own jungle
baloo will surely beat me but that is better than chasing silly rose leaves with the bandarlog
no sooner had he walked to the city wall than the monkeys pulled him back telling him that he did not know how happy he was and pinching him to make him grateful
he set his teeth and said nothing but went with the shouting monkeys to a terrace above the red sandstone reservoirs that were halffull of rain water
there was a ruined summerhouse of white marble in the center of the terrace built for queens dead a hundred years ago
the domed roof had half fallen in and blocked up the underground passage from the palace by which the queens used to enter
we are great
we are free
we are wonderful
we are the most wonderful people in all the jungle
we all say so and so it must be true they shouted
now as you are a new listener and can carry our words back to the junglepeople so that they may notice us in future we will tell you all about our most excellent selves
mowgli made no objection and the monkeys gathered by hundreds and hundreds on the terrace to listen to their own speakers singing the praises of the
bandarlog and whenever a speaker stopped for want of breath they would all shout together this is true we all say so
mowgli nodded and blinked and said yes when they asked him a question and his head spun with the noise
tabaqui the jackal must have bitten all these people he said to himself and now they have madness
certainly this is dewanee the madness
do they never go to sleep
now there is a cloud coming to cover that moon
if it were only a big enough cloud i might try to run away in the darkness
but i am tired
the monkeys never fight unless they are a hundred to one and few in the jungle care for those odds
i will go to the west wall kaa whispered and come down swiftly with the slope of the ground in my favor
they will not throw themselves upon my back in their hundreds but i know it said bagheera
would that baloo were here but we must do what we can
when that cloud covers the moon i shall go to the terrace
they hold some sort of council there over the boy
good hunting said kaa grimly and glided away to the west wall
that happened to be the least ruined of any and the big snake was delayed awhile before he could find a way up the stones
the cloud hid the moon and as mowgli wondered what would come next he heard bagheeras light feet on the terrace
there was a howl of fright and rage and then as bagheera tripped on the rolling kicking bodies beneath him a monkey shouted there is only one here
a scuffling mass of monkeys biting scratching tearing and pulling closed over
bagheera while five or six laid hold of mowgli dragged him up the wall of the summerhouse and pushed him through the hole of the broken dome
a mantrained boy would have been badly bruised for the fall was a good fifteen feet but mowgli fell as baloo had taught him to fall and landed on his feet
stay there shouted the monkeys till we have killed thy friends and later we will play with theeif the poisonpeople leave thee alive
we be of one blood ye and i said mowgli quickly giving the snakes
he could hear rustling and hissing in the rubbish all round him and gave the call a second time to make sure
down hoods all
said half a dozen low voices every ruin in india becomes sooner or later a dwelling place of snakes and the old summerhouse was alive with cobras
stand still little brother for thy feet may do us harm
for the first time since he was born bagheera was fighting for his life
baloo must be at hand bagheera would not have come alone mowgli thought
and then he called aloud to the tank bagheera
roll to the water tanks
roll and plunge
get to the water
bagheera heard and the cry that told him mowgli was safe gave him new courage
he worked his way desperately inch by inch straight for the reservoirs halting in silence
then from the ruined wall nearest the jungle rose up the rumbling warshout of baloo
the old bear had done his best but he could not come before
bagheera he shouted i am here
the stones slip under my feet
wait my coming o most infamous bandarlog
a crash and a splash told
mowgli that bagheera had fought his way to the tank where the monkeys could not follow
it was then that bagheera lifted up his dripping chin and in despair gave the snakes call for protectionwe be of one blood ye and ifor he believed that kaa had turned tail at the last minute
even baloo half smothered under the monkeys on the edge of the terrace could not help chuckling as he heard the black
panther asking for help
kaa had only just worked his way over the west wall landing with a wrench that dislodged a coping stone into the ditch
he had no intention of losing any advantage of the ground and coiled and uncoiled himself once or twice to be sure that every foot of his long body was in working order
all that while the fight with baloo went on and the monkeys yelled in the tank round bagheera and mang the bat flying to and fro carried the news of the great battle over the jungle till even
then kaa came straight quickly and anxious to kill
the fighting strength of a python is in the driving blow of his head backed by all the strength and weight of his body
if you can imagine a lance or a battering ram or a hammer weighing nearly half a ton driven by a cool quiet mind living in the handle of it you can roughly imagine what kaa was like when he fought
a python four or five feet long can knock a man down if he hits him fairly in the chest and
kaa was thirty feet long as you know
his first stroke was delivered into the heart of the crowd round baloo
it was sent home with shut mouth in silence and there was no need of a second
the monkeys scattered with cries ofkaa
kaa was everything that the monkeys feared in the jungle for none of them knew the limits of his power none of them could look him in the face and none had ever come alive out of his hug
and so they ran stammering with terror to the walls and the roofs of the houses and baloo drew a deep breath of relief
his fur was much thicker than bagheeras but he had suffered sorely in the fight
the monkeys on the walls and the empty houses stopped their cries and in the stillness that fell upon the city mowgli heard
bagheera shaking his wet sides as he came up from the tank
then the clamor broke out again
the monkeys leaped higher up the walls
get the mancub out of that trap i can do no more bagheera gasped
let us take the mancub and go
they may attack again
they will not move till i order them
stay you sssso
kaa hissed and the city was silent once more
i could not come before brother but i think i heard thee callthis was to bagheera
ii may have cried out in the battle bagheera answered
baloo art thou hurt
i am not sure that they did not pull me into a hundred little bearlings said baloo gravely shaking one leg after the other
kaa we owe thee i think our livesbagheera and i
where is the manling
here in a trap
i cannot climb out cried mowgli
the curve of the broken dome was above his head
take him away
he dances like mao the peacock
he will crush our young said the cobras inside
said kaa with a chuckle he has friends everywhere this manling
stand back manling
and hide you o poison people
i break down the wall
the screenwork broke and fell away in a cloud of dust and rubbish and mowgli leaped through the opening and flung himself between
baloo and bagheeraan arm around each big neck
art thou hurt
said baloo hugging him softly
i am sore hungry and not a little bruised
but oh they have handled ye grievously my brothers
others also said bagheera licking his lips and looking at the monkeydead on the terrace and round the tank
it is nothing it is nothing if thou art safe oh my pride of all little frogs
whimpered baloo
of that we shall judge later said bagheera in a dry voice that
mowgli did not at all like
but here is kaa to whom we owe the battle and thou owest thy life
thank him according to our customs mowgli
mowgli turned and saw the great pythons head swaying a foot above his own
so this is the manling said kaa
very soft is his skin and he is not unlike the bandarlog
have a care manling that i do not mistake thee for a monkey some twilight when i have newly changed my coat
we be one blood thou and i mowgli answered
i take my life from thee tonight
my kill shall be thy kill if ever thou art hungry o kaa
all thanks little brother said kaa though his eyes twinkled
and what may so bold a hunter kill
i ask that i may follow when next he goes abroad
i kill nothingi am too littlebut i drive goats toward such as can use them
when thou art empty come to me and see if i speak the truth
i have some skill in these he held out his hands and if ever thou art in a trap i may pay the debt which i owe to thee to bagheera and to
baloo here
good hunting to ye all my masters
well said growled baloo for mowgli had returned thanks very prettily
the python dropped his head lightly for a minute on mowglis shoulder
a brave heart and a courteous tongue said he
they shall carry thee far through the jungle manling
but now go hence quickly with thy friends
go and sleep for the moon sets and what follows it is not well that thou shouldst see
the moon was sinking behind the hills and the lines of trembling monkeys huddled together on the walls and battlements looked like ragged shaky fringes of things
the moon sets he said
is there yet light enough to see
from the walls came a moan like the wind in the treetopswe see o
begins now the dancethe dance of the hunger of kaa
sit still and watch
he turned twice or thrice in a big circle weaving his head from right to left
it grew darker and darker till at last the dragging shifting coils disappeared but they could hear the rustle of the scales
baloo and bagheera stood still as stone growling in their throats their neck hair bristling and mowgli watched and wondered
bandarlog said the voice of kaa at last can ye stir foot or hand without my order
without thy order we cannot stir foot or hand o kaa
come all one pace nearer to me
the lines of the monkeys swayed forward helplessly and baloo and
bagheera took one stiff step forward with them
hissed kaa and they all moved again
mowgli laid his hands on baloo and bagheera to get them away and the two great beasts started as though they had been waked from a dream
keep thy hand on my shoulder bagheera whispered
keep it there or i must go backmust go back to kaa
it is only old kaa making circles on the dust said mowgli
and the three slipped off through a gap in the walls to the jungle
said baloo when he stood under the still trees again
never more will i make an ally of kaa and he shook himself all over
he knows more than we said bagheera trembling
in a little time had i stayed i should have walked down his throat
many will walk by that road before the moon rises again said baloo
he will have good huntingafter his own fashion
but what was the meaning of it all
said mowgli who did not know anything of a pythons powers of fascination
i saw no more than a big snake making foolish circles till the dark came
and his nose was all sore
mowgli said bagheera angrily his nose was sore on thy account as my ears and sides and paws and baloos neck and shoulders are bitten on thy account
neither baloo nor bagheera will be able to hunt with pleasure for many days
it is nothing said baloo we have the mancub again
true but he has cost us heavily in time which might have been spent in good hunting in wounds in hairi am half plucked along my backand last of all in honor
for remember mowgli i who am the black
panther was forced to call upon kaa for protection and baloo and i were both made stupid as little birds by the hunger dance
all this mancub came of thy playing with the bandarlog
true it is true said mowgli sorrowfully
i am an evil mancub and my stomach is sad in me
what says the law of the jungle baloo
baloo did not wish to bring mowgli into any more trouble but he could not tamper with the law so he mumbled sorrow never stays punishment
but remember bagheera he is very little
i will remember
but he has done mischief and blows must be dealt now
mowgli hast thou anything to say
i did wrong
baloo and thou are wounded
it is just
when it was all over mowgli sneezed and picked himself up without a word
now said bagheera jump on my back little brother and we will go home
one of the beauties of jungle law is that punishment settles all scores
there is no nagging afterward
mowgli laid his head down on bagheeras back and slept so deeply that he never waked when he was put down in the homecave
roadsong of the bandarlog here we go in a flung festoon halfway up to the jealous moon
dont you envy our pranceful bands
dont you wish you had extra hands
wouldnt you like if your tails wereso curved in the shape of a cupids bow
now youre angry butnever mind brother thy tail hangs down behind
here we sit in a branchy row thinking of beautiful things we know dreaming of deeds that we mean to do all complete in a minute or two something noble and wise and good done by merely wishing we could
weve forgotten butnever mind brother thy tail hangs down behind
all the talk we ever have heard uttered by bat or beast or bird hide or fin or scale or feather jabber it quickly and all together
once again
now we are talking just like men
lets pretend we are
never mind brother thy tail hangs down behind
this is the way of the monkeykind
then join our leaping lines that scumfish through the pines that rocket by where light and high the wild grape swings
by the rubbish in our wake and the noble noise we make be sure be sure were going to do some splendid things
what of the hunting hunter bold
brother the watch was long and cold
what of the quarry ye went to kill
brother he crops in the jungle still
where is the power that made your pride
brother it ebbs from my flank and side
where is the haste that ye hurry by
brother i go to my lairto die
now we must go back to the first tale
so he hurried on keeping to the rough road that ran down the valley and followed it at a steady jogtrot for nearly twenty miles till he came to a country that he did not know
the valley opened out into a great plain dotted over with rocks and cut up by ravines
at one end stood a little village and at the other the thick jungle came down in a sweep to the grazinggrounds and stopped there as though it had been cut off with a hoe
mowgli walked on for he was feeling hungry and when he came to the village gate he saw the big thornbush that was drawn up before the gate at twilight pushed to one side
he said for he had come across more than one such barricade in his night rambles after things to eat
so men are afraid of the people of the jungle here also
he sat down by the gate and when a man came out he stood up opened his mouth and pointed down it to show that he wanted food
the man stared and ran back up the one street of the village shouting for the priest who was a big fat man dressed in white with a red and yellow mark on his forehead
the priest came to the gate and with him at least a hundred people who stared and talked and shouted and pointed at mowgli
they have no manners these men folk said mowgli to himself
only the gray ape would behave as they do
so he threw back his long hair and frowned at the crowd
what is there to be afraid of
said the priest
look at the marks on his arms and legs
they are the bites of wolves
he is but a wolfchild run away from the jungle
of course in playing together the cubs had often nipped mowgli harder than they intended and there were white scars all over his arms and legs
but he would have been the last person in the world to call these bites for he knew what real biting meant
said two or three women together
to be bitten by wolves poor child
he is a handsome boy
he has eyes like red fire
by my honor messua he is not unlike thy boy that was taken by the tiger
let me look said a woman with heavy copper rings on her wrists and ankles and she peered at mowgli under the palm of her hand
indeed he is not
he is thinner but he has the very look of my boy
the priest was a clever man and he knew that messua was wife to the richest villager in the place
so he looked up at the sky for a minute and said solemnly what the jungle has taken the jungle has restored
take the boy into thy house my sister and forget not to honor the priest who sees so far into the lives of men
by the bull that bought me said mowgli to himself but all this talking is like another lookingover by the pack
well if i am a man a man i must become
hindu god in a little alcove and on the wall a real looking glass such as they sell at the country fairs
so she said nathoo o nathoo
mowgli did not show that he knew the name
dost thou not remember the day when i gave thee thy new shoes
she touched his foot and it was almost as hard as horn
no she said sorrowfully those feet have never worn shoes but thou art very like my nathoo and thou shalt be my son
mowgli was uneasy because he had never been under a roof before
but as he looked at the thatch he saw that he could tear it out any time if he wanted to get away and that the window had no fastenings
what is the good of a man he said to himself at last if he does not understand mans talk
now i am as silly and dumb as a man would be with us in the jungle
i must speak their talk
it was not for fun that he had learned while he was with the wolves to imitate the challenge of bucks in the jungle and the grunt of the little wild pig
so as soon as messua pronounced a word mowgli would imitate it almost perfectly and before dark he had learned the names of many things in the hut
there was a difficulty at bedtime because mowgli would not sleep under anything that looked so like a panther trap as that hut and when they shut the door he went through the window
give him his will said
messuas husband
remember he can never till now have slept on a bed
if he is indeed sent in the place of our son he will not run away
so mowgli stretched himself in some long clean grass at the edge of the field but before he had closed his eyes a soft gray nose poked him under the chin
said gray brother he was the eldest of mother wolfs cubs
this is a poor reward for following thee twenty miles
thou smellest of wood smoke and cattlealtogether like a man already
wake little
brother i bring news
are all well in the jungle
said mowgli hugging him
all except the wolves that were burned with the red flower
now listen
shere khan has gone away to hunt far off till his coat grows again for he is badly singed
when he returns he swears that he will lay thy bones in the waingunga
there are two words to that
i also have made a little promise
but news is always good
i am tired tonightvery tired with new things
gray brotherbut bring me the news always
thou wilt not forget that thou art a wolf
men will not make thee forget
said gray brother anxiously
i will always remember that i love thee and all in our cave
but also i will always remember that i have been cast out of the pack
and that thou mayest be cast out of another pack
men are only men
little brother and their talk is like the talk of frogs in a pond
i come down here again i will wait for thee in the bamboos at the edge of the grazingground
for three months after that night mowgli hardly ever left the village gate he was so busy learning the ways and customs of men
first he had to wear a cloth round him which annoyed him horribly and then he had to learn about money which he did not in the least understand and about plowing of which he did not see the use
then the little children in the village made him very angry
he did not know his own strength in the least
in the jungle he knew he was weak compared with the beasts but in the village people said that he was as strong as a bull
and mowgli had not the faintest idea of the difference that caste makes between man and man
when the potters donkey slipped in the clay pit
mowgli hauled it out by the tail and helped to stack the pots for their journey to the market at khanhiwara
that was very shocking too for the potter is a lowcaste man and his donkey is worse
it was the village club and the headman and the watchman and the barber who knew all the gossip of the village and old buldeo the village hunter who had a tower musket met and smoked
they told wonderful tales of gods and men and ghosts and
buldeo told even more wonderful ones of the ways of beasts in the jungle till the eyes of the children sitting outside the circle bulged out of their heads
most of the tales were about animals for the jungle was always at their door
the deer and the wild pig grubbed up their crops and now and again the tiger carried off a man at twilight within sight of the village gates
buldeo was explaining how the tiger that had carried away messuas son was a ghosttiger and his body was inhabited by the ghost of a wicked old moneylender who had died some years ago
true true that must be the truth said the graybeards nodding together
are all these tales such cobwebs and moon talk
said mowgli
that tiger limps because he was born lame as everyone knows
to talk of the soul of a moneylender in a beast that never had the courage of a jackal is childs talk
buldeo was speechless with surprise for a moment and the headman stared
it is the jungle brat is it
said buldeo
if thou art so wise better bring his hide to khanhiwara for the government has set a hundred rupees on his life
better still talk not when thy elders speak
mowgli rose to go
all the evening i have lain here listening he called back over his shoulder and except once or twice buldeo has not said one word of truth concerning the jungle which is at his very doors
how then shall i believe the tales of ghosts and gods and goblins which he says he has seen
it is full time that boy went to herding said the headman while
buldeo puffed and snorted at mowglis impertinence
the custom of most indian villages is for a few boys to take the cattle and buffaloes out to graze in the early morning and bring them back at night
the very cattle that would trample a white man to death allow themselves to be banged and bullied and shouted at by children that hardly come up to their noses
so long as the boys keep with the herds they are safe for not even the tiger will charge a mob of cattle
but if they straggle to pick flowers or hunt lizards they are sometimes carried off
mowgli went through the village street in the dawn sitting on the back of rama the great herd bull
an indian grazing ground is all rocks and scrub and tussocks and little ravines among which the herds scatter and disappear
the buffaloes generally keep to the pools and muddy places where they lie wallowing or basking in the warm mud for hours
mowgli drove them on to the edge of the plain where the waingunga came out of the jungle then he dropped from ramas neck trotted off to a bamboo clump and found gray brother
ah said gray brother i have waited here very many days
what is the meaning of this cattleherding work
it is an order said mowgli
i am a village herd for a while
what news of shere khan
he has come back to this country and has waited here a long time for thee
now he has gone off again for the game is scarce
but he means to kill thee
very good said mowgli
so long as he is away do thou or one of the four brothers sit on that rock so that i can see thee as i come out of the village
when he comes back wait for me in the ravine by the dhak tree in the center of the plain
we need not walk into shere khans mouth
then mowgli picked out a shady place and lay down and slept while the buffaloes grazed round him
herding in india is one of the laziest things in the world
the cattle move and crunch and lie down and move on again and they do not even low
if shere khan had made a false step with his lame paw up in the jungles by the waingunga mowgli would have heard him in those long still mornings
at last a day came when he did not see gray brother at the signal place and he laughed and headed the buffaloes for the ravine by the dhk tree which was all covered with goldenred flowers
there sat gray brother every bristle on his back lifted
he has hidden for a month to throw thee off thy guard
he crossed the ranges last night with tabaqui hotfoot on thy trail said the wolf panting
mowgli frowned
i am not afraid of shere khan but tabaqui is very cunning
have no fear said gray brother licking his lips a little
tabaqui in the dawn
now he is telling all his wisdom to the kites but he told me everything before i broke his back
shere khans plan is to wait for thee at the village gate this eveningfor thee and for no one else
he is lying up now in the big dry ravine of the waingunga
has he eaten today or does he hunt empty
said mowgli for the answer meant life and death to him
he killed at dawna pigand he has drunk too
remember shere khan could never fast even for the sake of revenge
what a cubs cub it is
eaten and drunk too and he thinks that i shall wait till he has slept
now where does he lie up
if there were but ten of us we might pull him down as he lies
these buffaloes will not charge unless they wind him and i cannot speak their language
can we get behind his track so that they may smell it
he swam far down the waingunga to cut that off said gray brother
tabaqui told him that i know
he would never have thought of it alone
mowgli stood with his finger in his mouth thinking
the big ravine of the waingunga
that opens out on the plain not half a mile from here
i can take the herd round through the jungle to the head of the ravine and then sweep downbut he would slink out at the foot
we must block that end
gray brother canst thou cut the herd in two for me
not i perhapsbut i have brought a wise helper
gray brother trotted off and dropped into a hole
then there lifted up a huge gray head that
mowgli knew well and the hot air was filled with the most desolate cry of all the junglethe hunting howl of a wolf at midday
said mowgli clapping his hands
i might have known that thou wouldst not forget me
we have a big work in hand
cut the herd in two akela
keep the cows and calves together and the bulls and the plow buffaloes by themselves
the two wolves ran ladieschain fashion in and out of the herd which snorted and threw up its head and separated into two clumps
in one the cowbuffaloes stood with their calves in the center and glared and pawed ready if a wolf would only stay still to charge down and trample the life out of him
in the other the bulls and the young bulls snorted and stamped but though they looked more imposing they were much less dangerous for they had no calves to protect
no six men could have divided the herd so neatly
what orders
panted akela
they are trying to join again
mowgli slipped on to ramas back
drive the bulls away to the left
gray brother when we are gone hold the cows together and drive them into the foot of the ravine
said gray brother panting and snapping
till the sides are higher than shere khan can jump shouted mowgli
keep them there till we come down
the bulls swept off as akela bayed and gray brother stopped in front of the cows
they charged down on him and he ran just before them to the foot of the ravine as akela drove the bulls far to the left
another charge and they are fairly started
careful nowcareful akela
a snap too much and the bulls will charge
this is wilder work than driving blackbuck
didst thou think these creatures could move so swiftly
mowgli called
i havehave hunted these too in my time gasped akela in the dust
shall i turn them into the jungle
swiftly turn them
rama is mad with rage
oh if i could only tell him what i need of him today
the bulls were turned to the right this time and crashed into the standing thicket
the other herd children watching with the cattle half a mile away hurried to the village as fast as their legs could carry them crying that the buffaloes had gone mad and run away
but mowglis plan was simple enough
he was soothing the buffaloes now by voice and akela had dropped far to the rear only whimpering once or twice to hurry the rearguard
it was a long long circle for they did not wish to get too near the ravine and give shere khan warning
at last mowgli rounded up the bewildered herd at the head of the ravine on a grassy patch that sloped steeply down to the ravine itself
let them breathe akela he said holding up his hand
they have not winded him yet
let them breathe
i must tell shere khan who comes
we have him in the trap
he put his hands to his mouth and shouted down the ravineit was almost like shouting down a tunneland the echoes jumped from rock to rock
after a long time there came back the drawling sleepy snarl of a fullfed tiger just wakened
said shere khan and a splendid peacock fluttered up out of the ravine screeching
cattle thief it is time to come to the council rock
downhurry them down akela
down rama down
once started there was no chance of stopping and before they were fairly in the bed of the ravine rama winded shere khan and bellowed
said mowgli on his back
now thou knowest
they knew what the business was before themthe terrible charge of the buffalo herd against which no tiger can hope to stand
the herd splashed through the pool he had just left bellowing till the narrow cut rang
that charge carried both herds out into the plain goring and stamping and snorting
mowgli watched his time and slipped off ramas neck laying about him right and left with his stick
quick akela
break them up
scatter them or they will be fighting one another
drive them away akela
hai hai hai
my children
softly now softly
it is all over
akela and gray brother ran to and fro nipping the buffaloes legs and though the herd wheeled once to charge up the ravine again mowgli managed to turn rama and the others followed him to the wallows
shere khan needed no more trampling
he was dead and the kites were coming for him already
brothers that was a dogs death said mowgli feeling for the knife he always carried in a sheath round his neck now that he lived with men
but he would never have shown fight
his hide will look well on the
council rock
we must get to work swiftly
a boy trained among men would never have dreamed of skinning a tenfoot tiger alone but mowgli knew better than anyone else how an animals skin is fitted on and how it can be taken off
but it was hard work and mowgli slashed and tore and grunted for an hour while the wolves lolled out their tongues or came forward and tugged as he ordered them
presently a hand fell on his shoulder and looking up he saw buldeo with the tower musket
the children had told the village about the buffalo stampede and buldeo went out angrily only too anxious to correct
mowgli for not taking better care of the herd
the wolves dropped out of sight as soon as they saw the man coming
what is this folly
said buldeo angrily
to think that thou canst skin a tiger
where did the buffaloes kill him
it is the lame tiger too and there is a hundred rupees on his head
well well we will overlook thy letting the herd run off and perhaps i will give thee one of the rupees of the reward when i have taken the skin to khanhiwara
he fumbled in his waist cloth for flint and steel and stooped down to singe shere khans whiskers
most native hunters always singe a tigers whiskers to prevent his ghost from haunting them
said mowgli half to himself as he ripped back the skin of a forepaw
so thou wilt take the hide to khanhiwara for the reward and perhaps give me one rupee
now it is in my mind that i need the skin for my own use
old man take away that fire
what talk is this to the chief hunter of the village
thy luck and the stupidity of thy buffaloes have helped thee to this kill
the tiger has just fed or he would have gone twenty miles by this time
thou canst not even skin him properly little beggar brat and forsooth i buldeo must be told not to singe his whiskers
mowgli i will not give thee one anna of the reward but only a very big beating
leave the carcass
by the bull that bought me said mowgli who was trying to get at the shoulder must i stay babbling to an old ape all noon
here akela this man plagues me
buldeo who was still stooping over shere khans head found himself sprawling on the grass with a gray wolf standing over him while mowgli went on skinning as though he were alone in all india
yees he said between his teeth
thou art altogether right buldeo
thou wilt never give me one anna of the reward
there is an old war between this lame tiger and myselfa very old war andi have won
it was sorcery magic of the worst kind thought buldeo and he wondered whether the amulet round his neck would protect him
he lay as still as still expecting every minute to see
mowgli turn into a tiger too
great king he said at last in a husky whisper
yes said mowgli without turning his head chuckling a little
i am an old man
i did not know that thou wast anything more than a herdsboy
may i rise up and go away or will thy servant tear me to pieces
go and peace go with thee
only another time do not meddle with my game
let him go akela
buldeo hobbled away to the village as fast as he could looking back over his shoulder in case mowgli should change into something terrible
when he got to the village he told a tale of magic and enchantment and sorcery that made the priest look very grave
mowgli went on with his work but it was nearly twilight before he and the wolves had drawn the great gay skin clear of the body
now we must hide this and take the buffaloes home
help me to herd them akela
the herd rounded up in the misty twilight and when they got near the village mowgli saw lights and heard the conches and bells in the temple blowing and banging
half the village seemed to be waiting for him by the gate
that is because i have killed shere khan he said to himself
but a shower of stones whistled about his ears and the villagers shouted sorcerer
wolfs brat
jungle demon
get hence quickly or the priest will turn thee into a wolf again
buldeo shoot
the old tower musket went off with a bang and a young buffalo bellowed in pain
more sorcery
shouted the villagers
he can turn bullets
buldeo that was thy buffalo
now what is this
said mowgli bewildered as the stones flew thicker
they are not unlike the pack these brothers of thine said akela sitting down composedly
it is in my head that if bullets mean anything they would cast thee out
shouted the priest waving a sprig of the sacred tulsi plant
last time it was because i was a man
this time it is because i am a wolf
let us go akela
a womanit was messuaran across to the herd and cried oh my son my son
they say thou art a sorcerer who can turn himself into a beast at will
i do not believe but go away or they will kill thee
buldeo says thou art a wizard but i know thou hast avenged nathoos death
come back messua
shouted the crowd
come back or we will stone thee
mowgli laughed a little short ugly laugh for a stone had hit him in the mouth
run back messua
this is one of the foolish tales they tell under the big tree at dusk
i have at least paid for thy sons life
farewell and run quickly for i shall send the herd in more swiftly than their brickbats
i am no wizard messua
now once more akela he cried
bring the herd in
the buffaloes were anxious enough to get to the village
they hardly needed akelas yell but charged through the gate like a whirlwind scattering the crowd right and left
keep count
shouted mowgli scornfully
it may be that i have stolen one of them
keep count for i will do your herding no more
fare you well children of men and thank messua that i do not come in with my wolves and hunt you up and down your street
he turned on his heel and walked away with the lone wolf and as he looked up at the stars he felt happy
no more sleeping in traps for me
let us get shere khans skin and go away
no we will not hurt the village for messua was kind to me
then they banged the temple bells and blew the conches louder than ever
and messua cried and buldeo embroidered the story of his adventures in the jungle till he ended by saying that
akela stood up on his hind legs and talked like a man
the moon was just going down when mowgli and the two wolves came to the hill of the council rock and they stopped at mother wolfs cave
they have cast me out from the manpack mother shouted mowgli but
i come with the hide of shere khan to keep my word
mother wolf walked stiffly from the cave with the cubs behind her and her eyes glowed as she saw the skin
i told him on that day when he crammed his head and shoulders into this cave hunting for thy life little frogi told him that the hunter would be the hunted
it is well done
little brother it is well done said a deep voice in the thicket
we were lonely in the jungle without thee and bagheera came running to mowglis bare feet
they clambered up the council rock together and
ever since akela had been deposed the pack had been without a leader hunting and fighting at their own pleasure
but they answered the call from habit and some of them were lame from the traps they had fallen into and some limped from shot wounds and some were mangy from eating bad food and many were missing
but they came to the council rock all that were left of them and saw shere khans striped hide on the rock and the huge claws dangling at the end of the empty dangling feet
look well o wolves
have i kept my word
said mowgli
and the wolves bayed yes and one tattered wolf howled lead us again o akela
lead us again o mancub for we be sick of this lawlessness and we would be the free people once more
nay purred bagheera that may not be
when ye are fullfed the madness may come upon you again
not for nothing are ye called the free
ye fought for freedom and it is yours
eat it o wolves
manpack and wolfpack have cast me out said mowgli
now i will hunt alone in the jungle
and we will hunt with thee said the four cubs
so mowgli went away and hunted with the four cubs in the jungle from that day on
but he was not always alone because years afterward he became a man and married
but that is a story for grownups
mowglis song that he sang at the council rock when he danced on shere khans hide the song of mowglii mowgli am singing
let the jungle listen to the things i have done
shere khan said he would killwould kill
at the gates in the twilight he would kill mowgli the frog
he ate and he drank
drink deep shere khan for when wilt thou drink again
sleep and dream of the kill
i am alone on the grazinggrounds
gray brother come to me
come to me lone wolf for there is big game afoot
bring up the great bull buffaloes the blueskinned herd bulls with the angry eyes
drive them to and fro as i order
sleepest thou still shere khan
wake oh wake
here come i and the bulls are behind
rama the king of the buffaloes stamped with his foot
waters of the waingunga whither went shere khan
he is not ikki to dig holes nor mao the peacock that he should fly
he is not mang the bat to hang in the branches
little bamboos that creak together tell me where he ran
he is there
he is there
under the feet of rama lies the lame one
up shere khan
up and kill
here is meat break the necks of the bulls
he is asleep
we will not wake him for his strength is very great
the kites have come down to see it
the black ants have come up to know it
there is a great assembly in his honor
i have no cloth to wrap me
the kites will see that i am naked
i am ashamed to meet all these people
lend me thy coat shere khan
lend me thy gay striped coat that i may go to the council rock
by the bull that bought me i made a promisea little promise
only thy coat is lacking before i keep my word
with the knife with the knife that men use with the knife of the hunter i will stoop down for my gift
waters of the waingunga shere khan gives me his coat for the love that he bears me
pull gray brother
pull akela
heavy is the hide of shere khan
the man pack are angry
they throw stones and talk childs talk
my mouth is bleeding
let me run away
through the night through the hot night run swiftly with me my brothers
we will leave the lights of the village and go to the low moon
waters of the waingunga the manpack have cast me out
i did them no harm but they were afraid of me
wolf pack ye have cast me out too
the jungle is shut to me and the village gates are shut
as mang flies between the beasts and birds so fly i between the village and the jungle
i dance on the hide of shere khan but my heart is very heavy
my mouth is cut and wounded with the stones from the village but my heart is very light because i have come back to the jungle
these two things fight together in me as the snakes fight in the spring
the water comes out of my eyes yet i laugh while it falls
i am two mowglis but the hide of shere khan is under my feet
all the jungle knows that i have killed shere khan
looklook well o wolves
my heart is heavy with the things that i do not understand
the white seal oh
hush thee my baby the night is behind us and black are the waters that sparkled so green
the moon oer the combers looks downward to find us at rest in the hollows that rustle between
where billow meets billow then soft be thy pillow ah weary wee flipperling curl at thy ease
the storm shall not wake thee nor shark overtake thee asleep in the arms of the slowswinging seas
seal lullaby
all these things happened several years ago at a place called
novastoshnah or north east point on the island of st
paul away and away in the bering sea
pauls again
limmershin is a very quaint little bird but he knows how to tell the truth
nobody comes to novastoshnah except on business and the only people who have regular business there are the seals
they come in the summer months by hundreds and hundreds of thousands out of the cold gray sea
for novastoshnah beach has the finest accommodation for seals of any place in all the world
sea catch knew that and every spring would swim from whatever place he happened to be inwould swim like a torpedoboat straight for
novastoshnah and spend a month fighting with his companions for a good place on the rocks as close to the sea as possible
sea catch was fifteen years old a huge gray fur seal with almost a mane on his shoulders and long wicked dog teeth
when he heaved himself up on his front flippers he stood more than four feet clear of the ground and his weight if anyone had been bold enough to weigh him was nearly seven hundred pounds
he was scarred all over with the marks of savage fights but he was always ready for just one fight more
yet sea catch never chased a beaten seal for that was against the rules of the beach
he only wanted room by the sea for his nursery
but as there were forty or fifty thousand other seals hunting for the same thing each spring the whistling bellowing roaring and blowing on the beach was something frightful
they fought in the breakers they fought in the sand and they fought on the smoothworn basalt rocks of the nurseries for they were just as stupid and unaccommodating as men
they were called the holluschickiethe bachelorsand there were perhaps two or three hundred thousand of them at novastoshnah alone
sea catch had just finished his fortyfifth fight one spring when
matkah his soft sleek gentleeyed wife came up out of the sea and he caught her by the scruff of the neck and dumped her down on his reservation saying gruffly late as usual
where have you been
it was not the fashion for sea catch to eat anything during the four months he stayed on the beaches and so his temper was generally bad
matkah knew better than to answer back
she looked round and cooed how thoughtful of you
youve taken the old place again
i should think i had said sea catch
look at me
he was scratched and bleeding in twenty places one eye was almost out and his sides were torn to ribbons
oh you men you men
matkah said fanning herself with her hind flipper
why cant you be sensible and settle your places quietly
you look as though you had been fighting with the killer whale
i havent been doing anything but fight since the middle of may
the beach is disgracefully crowded this season
ive met at least a hundred seals from lukannon beach house hunting
why cant people stay where they belong
ive often thought we should be much happier if we hauled out at otter
island instead of this crowded place said matkah
only the holluschickie go to otter island
if we went there they would say we were afraid
we must preserve appearances my dear
sea catch sunk his head proudly between his fat shoulders and pretended to go to sleep for a few minutes but all the time he was keeping a sharp lookout for a fight
now that all the seals and their wives were on the land you could hear their clamor miles out to sea above the loudest gales
it is nearly always foggy at
novastoshnah except when the sun comes out and makes everything look all pearly and rainbowcolored for a little while
sea catch she said at last our babys going to be white
empty clamshells and dry seaweed
snorted sea catch
there never has been such a thing in the world as a white seal
i cant help that said matkah theres going to be now
are bad for baby seals dear rat as bad as bad can be but splash and grow strong and you cant be wrong
child of the open sea
of course the little fellow did not understand the words at first
he paddled and scrambled about by his mothers side and learned to scuffle out of the way when his father was fighting with another seal and the two rolled and roared up and down the slippery rocks
matkah used to go to sea to get things to eat and the baby was fed only once in two days but then he ate all he could and throve upon it
the first thing he did was to crawl inland and there he met tens of thousands of babies of his own age and they played together like puppies went to sleep on the clean sand and played again
the old people in the nurseries took no notice of them and the holluschickie kept to their own grounds and the babies had a beautiful playtime
when matkah came back from her deepsea fishing she would go straight to their playground and call as a sheep calls for a lamb and wait until she heard kotick bleat
then she would take the straightest of straight lines in his direction striking out with her fore flippers and knocking the youngsters head over heels right and left
there were always a few hundred mothers hunting for their children through the playgrounds and the babies were kept lively
little seals can no more swim than little children but they are unhappy till they learn
after that he learned to lie in a beach pool and let the wash of the waves just cover him and lift him up while he paddled but he always kept his eye open for big waves that might hurt
late in october the seals began to leave st
pauls for the deep sea by families and tribes and there was no more fighting over the nurseries and the holluschickie played anywhere they liked
next year said
matkah to kotick you will be a holluschickie but this year you must learn how to catch fish
they set out together across the pacific and matkah showed kotick how to sleep on his back with his flippers tucked down by his side and his little nose just out of the water
no cradle is so comfortable as the long rocking swell of the pacific
when kotick felt his skin tingle all over matkah told him he was learning the feel of the water and that tingly prickly feelings meant bad weather coming and he must swim hard and get away
in a little time she said youll know where to swim to but just now well follow sea pig the porpoise for he is very wise
a school of porpoises were ducking and tearing through the water and little
kotick followed them as fast as he could
how do you know where to go to
the leader of the school rolled his white eye and ducked under
my tail tingles youngster he said
that means theres a gale behind me
come along
when youre south of the sticky water he meant the equator and your tail tingles that means theres a gale in front of you and you must head north
come along
the water feels bad here
this was one of very many things that kotick learned and he was always learning
at the end of six months what kotick did not know about deepsea fishing was not worth the knowing
and all that time he never set flipper on dry ground
that very minute he turned north swimming steadily and as he went on he met scores of his mates all bound for the same place and they said greeting kotick
this year we are all holluschickie and we can dance the firedance in the breakers off
lukannon and play on the new grass
but where did you get that coat
koticks fur was almost pure white now and though he felt very proud of it he only said swim quickly
my bones are aching for the land
and so they all came to the beaches where they had been born and heard the old seals their fathers fighting in the rolling mist
that night kotick danced the firedance with the yearling seals
the sea is full of fire on summer nights all the way down from novastoshnah to
lukannon and each seal leaves a wake like burning oil behind him and a flaming flash when he jumps and the waves break in great phosphorescent streaks and swirls
then they went inland to the holluschickie grounds and rolled up and down in the new wild wheat and told stories of what they had done while they had been at sea
they talked about the pacific as boys would talk about a wood that they had been nutting in and if anyone had understood them he could have gone away and made such a chart of that ocean as never was
the three and fouryearold holluschickie romped down from hutchinsons hill crying out of the way youngsters
the sea is deep and you dont know all thats in it yet
wait till youve rounded the horn
hi you yearling where did you get that white coat
i didnt get it said kotick
and just as he was going to roll the speaker over a couple of blackhaired men with flat red faces came from behind a sand dune and kotick who had never seen a man before coughed and lowered his head
the holluschickie just bundled off a few yards and sat staring stupidly
the men were no less than kerick
booterin the chief of the sealhunters on the island and patalamon his son
said patalamon
theres a white seal
kerick booterin turned nearly white under his oil and smoke for he was an aleut and aleuts are not clean people
then he began to mutter a prayer
dont touch him patalamon
there has never been a white seal sincesince i was born
perhaps it is old zaharrofs ghost
he was lost last year in the big gale
im not going near him said patalamon
hes unlucky
do you really think he is old zaharrof come back
i owe him for some gulls eggs
dont look at him said kerick
head off that drove of fouryearolds
the men ought to skin two hundred today but its the beginning of the season and they are new to the work
a hundred will do
patalamon rattled a pair of seals shoulder bones in front of a herd of holluschickie and they stopped dead puffing and blowing
then he stepped near and the seals began to move and kerick headed them inland and they never tried to get back to their companions
hundreds and hundreds of thousands of seals watched them being driven but they went on playing just the same
kotick was the only one who asked questions and none of his companions could tell him anything except that the men always drove seals in that way for six weeks or two months of every year
i am going to follow he said and his eyes nearly popped out of his head as he shuffled along in the wake of the herd
the white seal is coming after us cried patalamon
thats the first time a seal has ever come to the killinggrounds alone
dont look behind you said kerick
it is zaharrofs ghost
i must speak to the priest about this
so they went on very slowly past sea lions neck past
webster house till they came to the salt house just beyond the sight of the seals on the beach
kotick followed panting and wondering
he thought that he was at the worlds end but the roar of the seal nurseries behind him sounded as loud as the roar of a train in a tunnel
then kerick sat down on the moss and pulled out a heavy pewter watch and let the drove cool off for thirty minutes and kotick could hear the fogdew dripping off the brim of his cap
and then the men clubbed the seals on the head as fast as they could
ten minutes later little kotick did not recognize his friends any more for their skins were ripped off from the nose to the hind flippers whipped off and thrown down on the ground in a pile
that was enough for kotick
he turned and galloped a seal can gallop very swiftly for a short time back to the sea his little new mustache bristling with horror
at sea lions neck where the great sea lions sit on the edge of the surf he flung himself flipperoverhead into the cool water and rocked there gasping miserably
whats here
said a sea lion gruffly for as a rule the sea lions keep themselves to themselves
ochen scoochnie
im lonesome very lonesome
theyre killing all the holluschickie on all the beaches
the sea lion turned his head inshore
your friends are making as much noise as ever
you must have seen old kerick polishing off a drove
hes done that for thirty years
its horrible said kotick backing water as a wave went over him and steadying himself with a screw stroke of his flippers that brought him all standing within three inches of a jagged edge of rock
well done for a yearling
said the sea lion who could appreciate good swimming
isnt there any such island
began kotick
ive followed the poltoos the halibut for twenty years and i cant say ive found it yet
but look hereyou seem to have a fondness for talking to your betterssuppose you go to walrus islet and talk to
he may know something
dont flounce off like that
its a sixmile swim and if i were you i should haul out and take a nap first little one
kotick thought that that was good advice so he swam round to his own beach hauled out and slept for half an hour twitching all over as seals will
then he headed straight for walrus islet a little low sheet of rocky island almost due northeast from novastoshnah all ledges and rock and gulls nests where the walrus herded by themselves
barked kotick for the gulls were making a great noise
whats that
said sea vitch and he struck the next walrus a blow with his tusks and waked him up and the next struck the next and so on till they were all awake and staring in every direction but the right one
its me said kotick bobbing in the surf and looking like a little white slug
may i beskinned
said sea vitch and they all looked at kotick as you can fancy a club full of drowsy old gentlemen would look at a little boy
kotick did not care to hear any more about skinning just then he had seen enough of it
so he called out isnt there any place for seals to go where men dont ever come
go and find out said sea vitch shutting his eyes
were busy here
kotick made his dolphinjump in the air and shouted as loud as he could clameater
he knew that sea vitch never caught a fish in his life but always rooted for clams and seaweed though he pretended to be a very terrible person
naturally the chickies and the gooverooskies and the epatkasthe burgomaster gulls and the kittiwakes and the
puffins who are always looking for a chance to be rude took up the cry andso limmershin told mefor nearly five minutes you could not have heard a gun fired on walrus islet
all the population was yelling and screaming clameater
stareek old man
while sea vitch rolled from side to side grunting and coughing
now will you tell
said kotick all out of breath
go and ask sea cow said sea vitch
if he is living still hell be able to tell you
how shall i know sea cow when i meet him
said kotick sheering off
hes the only thing in the sea uglier than sea vitch screamed a
burgomaster gull wheeling under sea vitchs nose
uglier and with worse manners
kotick swam back to novastoshnah leaving the gulls to scream
there he found that no one sympathized with him in his little attempt to discover a quiet place for the seals
they told him that men had always driven the holluschickieit was part of the days workand that if he did not like to see ugly things he should not have gone to the killing grounds
but none of the other seals had seen the killing and that made the difference between him and his friends
besides kotick was a white seal
what you must do said old sea catch after he had heard his sons adventures is to grow up and be a big seal like your father and have a nursery on the beach and then they will leave you alone
in another five years you ought to be able to fight for yourself
even gentle
matkah his mother said you will never be able to stop the killing
go and play in the sea kotick
and kotick went off and danced the
firedance with a very heavy little heart
that autumn he left the beach as soon as he could and set off alone because of a notion in his bullethead
he was going to find sea cow if there was such a person in the sea and he was going to find a quiet island with good firm beaches for seals to live on where men could not get at them
so he explored and explored by himself from the north to the south pacific swimming as much as three hundred miles in a day and a night
if the beach was good and hard with a slope behind it for seals to play on there was always the smoke of a whaler on the horizon boiling down blubber and kotick knew what that meant
or else he could see that seals had once visited the island and been killed off and kotick knew that where men had come once they would come again
he picked up with an old stumpytailed albatross who told him that
yet as he pulled out against the gale he could see that even there had once been a seal nursery
and it was so in all the other islands that he visited
he went to the gallapagos a horrid dry place on the equator where he was nearly baked to death he went to the georgia islands the orkneys emerald island little nightingale island goughs island
bouvets island the crossets and even to a little speck of an island south of the cape of good hope
but everywhere the people of the sea told him the same things
seals had come to those islands once upon a time but men had killed them all off
