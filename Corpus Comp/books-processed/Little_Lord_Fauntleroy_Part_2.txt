exclaimed fauntleroy and a flush overspread his forehead
will it do if i write it
i dont always spell quite right when i havent a dictionary and nobody tells me
it will do answered the earl
higgins will not complain of the spelling
im not the philanthropist you are
dip your pen in the ink
fauntleroy took up the pen and dipped it in the inkbottle then he arranged himself in position leaning on the table
now he inquired what must i say
you may say higgins is not to be interfered with for the present and sign it fauntleroy said the earl
fauntleroy dipped his pen in the ink again and resting his arm began to write
it was rather a slow and serious process but he gave his whole soul to it
after a while however the manuscript was complete and he handed it to his grandfather with a smile slightly tinged with anxiety
do you think it will do
the earl looked at it and the corners of his mouth twitched a little
yes he answered higgins will find it entirely satisfactory
and he handed it to mr
mordaunt found written was this dear mr
newik if you pleas mr
higins is not to be intur feared with for the present and oblige
yours rispecferly fauntleroy
hobbs always signed his letters that way said fauntleroy and i thought id better say please
is that exactly the right way to spell interfered
its not exactly the way it is spelled in the dictionary answered the
i was afraid of that said fauntleroy
i ought to have asked
you see thats the way with words of more than one syllable you have to look in the dictionary
its always safest
ill write it over again
and write it over again he did making quite an imposing copy and taking precautions in the matter of spelling by consulting the earl himself
spelling is a curious thing he said
its so often different from what you expect it to be
i used to think please was spelled plees but it isnt you know and youd think dear was spelled dere if you didnt inquire
sometimes it almost discourages you
when he was gone fauntleroy who had accompanied him to the door went back to his grandfather
may i go to dearest now
i think she will be waiting for me
the earl was silent a moment
there is something in the stable for you to see first he said
ring the bell
if you please said fauntleroy with his quick little flush
im very much obliged but i think id better see it tomorrow
she will be expecting me all the time
very well answered the earl
we will order the carriage
then he added dryly its a pony
fauntleroy drew a long breath
he exclaimed
whose pony is it
yours replied the earl
cried the little fellow
minelike the things upstairs
yes said his grandfather
would you like to see it
shall i order it to be brought around
fauntleroys cheeks grew redder and redder
i never thought i should have a pony
i never thought that
how glad dearest will be
you give me everything dont you
do you wish to see it
inquired the earl
fauntleroy drew a long breath
i want to see it he said
i want to see it so much i can hardly wait
but im afraid there isnt time
you must go and see your mother this afternoon
asked the earl
you think you cant put it off
why said fauntleroy she has been thinking about me all the morning and i have been thinking about her
said the earl
you have have you
ring the bell
as they drove down the avenue under the arching trees he was rather silent
but fauntleroy was not
he talked about the pony
what color was it
how big was it
what was its name
what did it like to eat best
how old was it
how early in the morning might he get up and see it
dearest will be so glad
he kept saying
she will be so much obliged to you for being so kind to me
she knows i always liked ponies so much but we never thought i should have one
there was a little boy on fifth
avenue who had one and he used to ride out every morning and we used to take a walk past his house to see him
he leaned back against the cushions and regarded the earl with rapt interest for a few minutes and in entire silence
i think you must be the best person in the world he burst forth at last
you are always doing good arent you
and thinking about other people
dearest says that is the best kind of goodness not to think about yourself but to think about other people
that is just the way you are isnt it
his lordship was so dumfounded to find himself presented in such agreeable colors that he did not know exactly what to say
he felt that he needed time for reflection
to see each of his ugly selfish motives changed into a good and generous one by the simplicity of a child was a singular experience
fauntleroy went on still regarding him with admiring eyesthose great clear innocent eyes
you make so many people happy he said
theres michael and bridget and their ten children and the applewoman and dick and mr
hobbs and mr
higgins and mrs
higgins and their children and mr
mordauntbecause of course he was gladand dearest and me about the pony and all the other things
do you know ive counted it up on my fingers and in my mind and its twentyseven people youve been kind to
thats a good manytwentyseven
and i was the person who was kind to themwas i
said the earl
why yes you know answered fauntleroy
you made them all happy
do you know with some delicate hesitation that people are sometimes mistaken about earls when they dont know them
i am going to write him and tell him about it
what was mr
hobbss opinion of earls
asked his lordship
well you see the difficulty was replied his young companion that he didnt know any and hed only read about them in books
he thoughtyou mustnt mind itthat they were gory tyrants and he said he wouldnt have them hanging around his store
but if hed known you
im sure he would have felt quite different
i shall tell him about you
what shall you tell him
i shall tell him said fauntleroy glowing with enthusiasm that you are the kindest man i ever heard of
and you are always thinking of other people and making them happy andand i hope when i grow up i shall be just like you
just like me
repeated his lordship looking at the little kindling face
and a dull red crept up under his withered skin and he suddenly turned his eyes away and looked out of the carriage window at the great beechtrees with the sun shining on their glossy redbrown leaves
just like you said fauntleroy adding modestly if i can
im not good enough but im going to try
the carriage rolled on down the stately avenue under the beautiful broadbranched trees through the spaces of green shade and lanes of golden sunlight
he heard the whir of the partridges and the calls and songs of the birds and it all seemed even more beautiful to him than before
all his heart was filled with pleasure and happiness in the beauty that was on every side
but the old earl saw and heard very different things though he was apparently looking out too
he looked out on the broad acres which belonged to him and he knew what
fauntleroy did nothow far they extended what wealth they represented and how many people had homes on their soil
but at last the carriage having passed the gates and bowled through the green lanes for a short distance stopped
they had reached court lodge and fauntleroy was out upon the ground almost before the big footman had time to open the carriage door
the earl wakened from his reverie with a start
are we here
yes said fauntleroy
let me give you your stick
just lean on me when you get out
i am not going to get out replied his lordship brusquely
notnot to see dearest
exclaimed fauntleroy with astonished face
dearest will excuse me said the earl dryly
go to her and tell her that not even a new pony would keep you away
she will be disappointed said fauntleroy
she will want to see you very much
i am afraid not was the answer
the carriage will call for you as we come back
tell jeffries to drive on thomas
thomas closed the carriage door and after a puzzled look fauntleroy ran up the drive
the earl had the opportunityas mr
havisham once hadof seeing a pair of handsome strong little legs flash over the ground with astonishing rapidity
evidently their owner had no intention of losing any time
the carriage rolled slowly away but his lordship did not at once lean back he still looked out
through a space in the trees he could see the house door it was wide open
the little figure dashed up the steps another figurea little figure too slender and young in its black gownran to meet it
it seemed as if they flew together as fauntleroy leaped into his mothers arms hanging about her neck and covering her sweet young face with kisses
on the following sunday morning mr
mordaunt had a large congregation
indeed he could scarcely remember any sunday on which the church had been so crowded
people appeared upon the scene who seldom did him the honor of coming to hear his sermons
there were even people from hazelton which was the next parish
there were hearty sunburned farmers stout comfortable applecheeked wives in their best bonnets and most gorgeous shawls and half a dozen children or so to each family
the doctors wife was there with her four daughters
kimsey and mr
kimsey who kept the druggists shop and made pills and did up powders for everybody within ten miles sat in their pew mrs
in the course of the preceding week many wonderful stories had been told of little lord fauntleroy
but if youll believe me mrs
jennifer mum mrs
dibble had said fear that child does not knowso mr
thomas hisself says an set an smile he did an talked to his lordship as if theyd been friends ever since his first hour
an the earl so took aback mr
thomas says that he couldnt do nothing but listen and stare from under his eyebrows
thomass opinion mrs
bates mum that bad as he is he was pleased in his secret soul an proud too for a handsomer little fellow or with better manners though so oldfashioned mr
thomas says hed never wish to see
and then there had come the story of higgins
the reverend mr
mordaunt had told it at his own dinner table and the servants who had heard it had told it in the kitchen and from there it had spread like wildfire
and on marketday when higgins had appeared in town he had been questioned on every side and newick had been questioned too and in response had shown to two or three people the note signed fauntleroy
and so the farmers wives had found plenty to talk of over their tea and their shopping and they had done the subject full justice and made the most of it
it was by no means the earls habit to attend church but he chose to appear on this first sundayit was his whim to present himself in the huge family pew with fauntleroy at his side
there were many loiterers in the churchyard and many lingerers in the lane that morning
there were groups at the gates and in the porch and there had been much discussion as to whether my lord would really appear or not
when this discussion was at its height one good woman suddenly uttered an exclamation
eh she said that must be the mother pretty young thing
all who heard turned and looked at the slender figure in black coming up the path
the veil was thrown back from her face and they could see how fair and sweet it was and how the bright hair curled as softly as a childs under the little widows cap
but soon she could not help being attracted by the fact that she was being looked at and that her arrival had created some sort of sensation
she first noticed it because an old woman in a red cloak made a bobbing courtesy to her and then another did the same thing and said god bless you my lady
and one man after another took off his hat as she passed
for a moment she did not understand and then she realized that it was because she was little
lord fauntleroys mother that they did so and she flushed rather shyly and smiled and bowed too and said thank you in a gentle voice to the old woman who had blessed her
she had scarcely passed through the stone porch into the church before the great event of the day happened
the carriage from the castle with its handsome horses and tall liveried servants bowled around the corner and down the green lane
here they come
went from one lookeron to another
and then the carriage drew up and thomas stepped down and opened the door and a little boy dressed in black velvet and with a splendid mop of bright waving hair jumped out
every man woman and child looked curiously upon him
hes the captain over again
said those of the onlookers who remembered his father
hes the captains self to the life
he stood there in the sunlight looking up at the earl as thomas helped that nobleman out with the most affectionate interest that could be imagined
the instant he could help he put out his hand and offered his shoulder as if he had been seven feet high
it was plain enough to every one that however it might be with other people the earl of dorincourt struck no terror into the breast of his grandson
just lean on me they heard him say
how glad the people are to see you and how well they all seem to know you
take off your cap fauntleroy said the earl
they are bowing to you
cried fauntleroy whipping off his cap in a moment baring his bright head to the crowd and turning shining puzzled eyes on them as he tried to bow to every one at once
god bless your lordship
said the courtesying redcloaked old woman who had spoken to his mother long life to you
thank you maam said fauntleroy
and then they went into the church and were looked at there on their way up the aisle to the square redcushioned and curtained pew
on the tablet by them was written something of which he could only read the curious words here lyeth ye bodye of gregorye arthure fyrst earle of dorincourt
allsoe of alisone hildegarde hys wyfe
may i whisper
inquired his lordship devoured by curiosity
what is it
said his grandfather
who are they
some of your ancestors answered the earl who lived a few hundred years ago
perhaps said lord fauntleroy regarding them with respect perhaps
i got my spelling from them
and then he proceeded to find his place in the church service
when the music began he stood up and looked across at his mother smiling
he was very fond of music and his mother and he often sang together so he joined in with the rest his pure sweet high voice rising as clear as the song of a bird
he quite forgot himself in his pleasure in it
the earl forgot himself a little too as he sat in his curtainshielded corner of the pew and watched the boy
there were many soft anxious thoughts in her tender heart in those new days
she had said to him the evening before as she hung over him in saying goodnight before he went away oh ceddie dear i wish for your sake i was very clever and could say a great many wise things
and that is best of all ceddieit is better than everything else that the world should be a little better because a man has livedeven ever so little better dearest
and on his return to the castle fauntleroy had repeated her words to his grandfather
and i thought about you when she said that he ended and i told her that was the way the world was because you had lived and i was going to try if i could be like you
and what did she say to that
asked his lordship a trifle uneasily
she said that was right and we must always look for good in people and try to be like it
perhaps it was this the old man remembered as he glanced through the divided folds of the red curtain of his pew
as they came out of church many of those who had attended the service stood waiting to see them pass
as they neared the gate a man who stood with his hat in his hand made a step forward and then hesitated
he was a middleaged farmer with a careworn face
well higgins said the earl
fauntleroy turned quickly to look at him
he exclaimed is it mr
yes answered the earl dryly and i suppose he came to take a look at his new landlord
yes my lord said the man his sunburned face reddening
newick told me his young lordship was kind enough to speak for me and i thought id like to say a word of thanks if i might be allowed
ive a great deal to thank your lordship for he said a great deal
i oh said fauntleroy i only wrote the letter
it was my grandfather who did it
but you know how he is about always being good to everybody
higgins well now
higgins looked a trifle taken aback
he also was somewhat startled at hearing his noble landlord presented in the character of a benevolent being full of engaging qualities
iwell yes your lordship he stammered the missus is better since the trouble was took off her mind
it was worrying broke her down
im glad of that said fauntleroy
my grandfather was very sorry about your children having the scarlet fever and so was i
he has had children himself
im his sons little boy you know
higgins was on the verge of being panicstricken
it was a little trying therefore to his lordships nerves to be told while he looked on his eyes gleaming from under his shaggy eyebrows that he felt an interest in scarlet fever
you see higgins broke in the earl with a fine grim smile you people have been mistaken in me
lord fauntleroy understands me
when you want reliable information on the subject of my character apply to him
get into the carriage fauntleroy
and fauntleroy jumped in and the carriage rolled away down the green lane and even when it turned the corner into the high road the earl was still grimly smiling
lord dorincourt had occasion to wear his grim smile many a time as the days passed by
indeed as his acquaintance with his grandson progressed he wore the smile so often that there were moments when it almost lost its grimness
there is no denying that before lord
fauntleroy had appeared on the scene the old man had been growing very tired of his loneliness and his gout and his seventy years
but he could not read all the time and he became more and more bored as he called it
he hated the long nights and days and he grew more and more savage and irritable
fauntleroy came and when the earl saw him fortunately for the little fellow the secret pride of the grandfather was gratified at the outset
if cedric had been a less handsome little fellow the old man might have taken so strong a dislike to him that he would not have given himself the chance to see his grandsons finer qualities
but he chose to think that cedrics beauty and fearless spirit were the results of the
dorincourt blood and a credit to the dorincourt rank
it had amused him to give into those childish hands the power to bestow a benefit on poor higgins
then it had gratified him to drive to church with cedric and to see the excitement and interest caused by the arrival
the morning the new pony had been tried the earl had been so pleased that he had almost forgotten his gout
he wondered if the boy would show signs of timidity
it was not a very small pony and he had often seen children lose courage in making their first essay at riding
fauntleroy mounted in great delight
he had never been on a pony before and he was in the highest spirits
wilkins the groom led the animal by the bridle up and down before the library window
hes a well plucked un he is wilkins remarked in the stable afterward with many grins
it werent no trouble to put him up
an a old un wouldnt ha sat any straighter when he were up
he sesses he to me wilkins he ses am i sitting up straight
they sit up straight at the circus ses he
an i ses as straight as a arrer your lordship
an he laughs as pleased as could be an he ses thats right he ses you tell me if i dont sit up straight
but sitting up straight and being led at a walk were not altogether and completely satisfactory
after a few minutes fauntleroy spoke to his grandfatherwatching him from the window cant i go by myself
he asked and cant i go faster
the boy on
fifth avenue used to trot and canter
do you think you could trot and canter
said the earl
i should like to try answered fauntleroy
his lordship made a sign to wilkins who at the signal brought up his own horse and mounted it and took fauntleroys pony by the leadingrein
now said the earl let him trot
the next few minutes were rather exciting to the small equestrian
he found that trotting was not so easy as walking and the faster the pony trotted the less easy it was
it jjolts a ggoogood dealdodoesnt it
he said to wilkins
ddoes it jjolt yyou
no my lord answered wilkins
youll get used to it in time
rise in your stirrups
im rirising all the ttime said fauntleroy
he was both rising and falling rather uncomfortably and with many shakes and bounces
he was out of breath and his face grew red but he held on with all his might and sat as straight as he could
the earl could see that from his window
when the riders came back within speaking distance after they had been hidden by the trees a few minutes
fauntleroys hat was off his cheeks were like poppies and his lips were set but he was still trotting manfully
stop a minute
said his grandfather
wheres your hat
wilkins touched his
it fell off your lordship he said with evident enjoyment
wouldnt let me stop to pick it up my lord
not much afraid is he
asked the earl dryly
him your lordship
exclaimed wilkins
i shouldnt say as he knowed what it meant
ive taught young genlemen to ride afore an i never see one stick on more determinder
said the earl to fauntleroy
want to get off
it jolts you more than you think it will admitted his young lordship frankly
and it tires you a little too but i dont want to get off
i want to learn how
as soon as ive got my breath i want to go back for the hat
the cleverest person in the world if he had undertaken to teach
fauntleroy how to please the old man who watched him could not have taught him anything which would have succeeded better
and he sat and watched quite eagerly until the sound of the horses hoofs returned
when they did come which was after some time they came at a faster pace
fauntleroys hat was still off wilkins was carrying it for him his cheeks were redder than before and his hair was flying about his ears but he came at quite a brisk canter
he panted as they drew up i ccantered
i didnt do it as well as the boy on fifth avenue but i did it and i staid on
he and wilkins and the pony were close friends after that
scarcely a day passed in which the country people did not see them out together cantering gayly on the highroad or through the green lanes
goodmorning
in a very unlordly manner though with great heartiness
an im blessed said wilkins in telling the story at the stablesim blessed if hed hear of anything else
he wouldnt let me get down because he said the boy mightnt feel comfortable on a big horse
an ses he wilkins ses he that boys lame and im not and i want to talk to him too
and up the lad has to get and my lord trudges alongside of him with his hands in his pockets and his cap on the back of his head awhistling and talking as easy as you please
an im blessed if the woman wasnt struck all of a heap as well she might be
i thought i should a hexplodid myself
hartle the lame boys name was hartle with these words my grandfathers compliments and if you please these are for your boy and we hope he will get better
i said your compliments he explained to the earl when he returned to the carriage
you didnt tell me to but i thought perhaps you forgot
that was right wasnt it
and the earl laughed again and did not say it was not
in fact the two were becoming more intimate every day and every day fauntleroys faith in his lordships benevolence and virtue increased
he had no doubt whatever that his grandfather was the most amiable and generous of elderly gentlemen
certainly he himself found his wishes gratified almost before they were uttered and such gifts and pleasures were lavished upon him that he was sometimes almost bewildered by his own possessions
apparently he was to have everything he wanted and to do everything he wished to do
and though this would certainly not have been a very wise plan to pursue with all small boys his young lordship bore it amazingly well
perhaps notwithstanding his sweet nature he might have been somewhat spoiled by it if it had not been for the hours he spent with his mother at court lodge
that best friend of his watched over him ever closely and tenderly
the two had many long talks together and he never went back to the castle with her kisses on his cheeks without carrying in his heart some simple pure words worth remembering
there was one thing it is true which puzzled the little fellow very much
he thought over the mystery of it much oftener than any one supposed even his mother did not know how often he pondered on it the
earl for a long time never suspected that he did so at all
but being quick to observe the little boy could not help wondering why it was that his mother and grandfather never seemed to meet
he had noticed that they never did meet
when the dorincourt carriage stopped at
court lodge the earl never alighted and on the rare occasions of his lordships going to church fauntleroy was always left to speak to his mother in the porch alone or perhaps to go home with her
and yet every day fruit and flowers were sent to court lodge from the hothouses at the castle
but the one virtuous action of the earls which had set him upon the pinnacle of perfection in cedrics eyes was what he had done soon after that first sunday when mrs
errol had walked home from church unattended
about a week later when cedric was going one day to visit his mother he found at the door instead of the large carriage and prancing pair a pretty little brougham and a handsome bay horse
that is a present from you to your mother the earl said abruptly
she can not go walking about the country
she needs a carriage
the man who drives will take charge of it
it is a present from you
fauntleroys delight could but feebly express itself
he could scarcely contain himself until he reached the lodge
his mother was gathering roses in the garden
he flung himself out of the little brougham and flew to her
he cried could you believe it
this is yours
he says it is a present from me
it is your own carriage to drive everywhere in
he was so happy that she did not know what to say
she could not have borne to spoil his pleasure by refusing to accept the gift even though it came from the man who chose to consider himself her enemy
she was obliged to step into the carriage roses and all and let herself be taken to drive while fauntleroy told her stories of his grandfathers goodness and amiability
the very next day after that fauntleroy wrote to mr
he wrote quite a long letter and after the first copy was written he brought it to his grandfather to be inspected
because he said its so uncertain about the spelling
and if youll tell me the mistakes ill write it out again
p s he is such a good earl he reminds me of you he is a unerversle favrit do you miss your mother very much
asked the earl when he had finished reading this
yes said fauntleroy i miss her all the time
he went and stood before the earl and put his hand on his knee looking up at him
you dont miss her do you
i dont know her answered his lordship rather crustily
i know that said fauntleroy and thats what makes me wonder
she told me not to ask you any questions andand i wont but sometimes i cant help thinking you know and it makes me all puzzled
but im not going to ask any questions
and when i miss her very much i go and look out of my window to where i see her light shine for me every night through an open place in the trees
it is a long way off but she puts it in her window as soon as it is dark and i can see it twinkle far away and i know what it says
what does it say
asked my lord
it says goodnight god keep you all the night
just what she used to say when we were together
every night she used to say that to me and every morning she said god bless you all the day
so you see i am quite safe all the time quite i have no doubt said his lordship dryly
and he drew down his beetling eyebrows and looked at the little boy so fixedly and so long that fauntleroy wondered what he could be thinking of
the fact was his lordship the earl of dorincourt thought in those days of many things of which he had never thought before and all his thoughts were in one way or another connected with his grandson
his pride was the strongest part of his nature and the boy gratified it at every point
through this pride he began to find a new interest in life
he began to take pleasure in showing his heir to the world
the world had known of his disappointment in his sons so there was an agreeable touch of triumph in exhibiting this new lord fauntleroy who could disappoint no one
he wished the child to appreciate his own power and to understand the splendor of his position he wished that others should realize it too
he made plans for his future
the thought even made him feel a trifle nervous
he did not wish the boy to find it out
sometimes in this new interest he forgot his gout and after a while his doctor was surprised to find his noble patients health growing better than he had expected it ever would be again
perhaps the earl grew better because the time did not pass so slowly for him and he had something to think of beside his pains and infirmities
one fine morning people were amazed to see little lord fauntleroy riding his pony with another companion than wilkins
this new companion rode a tall powerful gray horse and was no other than the earl himself
it was in fact fauntleroy who had suggested this plan
as he had been on the point of mounting his pony he had said rather wistfully to his grandfather i wish you were going with me
when i go away i feel lonely because you are left all by yourself in such a big castle
i wish you could ride too
and the greatest excitement had been aroused in the stables a few minutes later by the arrival of an order that selim was to be saddled for the earl
and in their rides together through the green lanes and pretty country roads the two riders became more intimate than ever
and gradually the old man heard a great deal about dearest and her life
as fauntleroy trotted by the big horse he chatted gayly
there could not well have been a brighter little comrade his nature was so happy
it was he who talked the most
the earl often was silent listening and watching the joyous glowing face
one thing that the earl discovered was that his sons wife did not lead an idle life
it was not long before he learned that the poor people knew her very well indeed
when there was sickness or sorrow or poverty in any house the little brougham often stood before the door
do you know said fauntleroy once they all say god bless you
when they see her and the children are glad
there are some who go to her house to be taught to sew
she says she feels so rich now that she wants to help the poor ones
and yet he was often conscious of a hard jealous pang when he saw how she filled her childs heart and how the boy clung to her as his best beloved
the old man would have desired to stand first himself and have no rival
that same morning he drew up his horse on an elevated point of the moor over which they rode and made a gesture with his whip over the broad beautiful landscape spread before them
do you know that all that land belongs to me
he said to fauntleroy
answered fauntleroy
how much it is to belong to one person and how beautiful
do you know that some day it will all belong to youthat and a great deal more
exclaimed fauntleroy in rather an awestricken voice
when i am dead his grandfather answered
then i dont want it said fauntleroy i want you to live always
thats kind answered the earl in his dry way nevertheless some day it will all be yourssome day you will be the earl of dorincourt
little lord fauntleroy sat very still in his saddle for a few moments
he looked over the broad moors the green farms the beautiful copses the cottages in the lanes the pretty village and over the trees to where the turrets of the great castle rose gray and stately
then he gave a queer little sigh
what are you thinking of
asked the earl
i am thinking replied fauntleroy what a little boy i am
and of what dearest said to me
what was it
inquired the earl
and i was just looking at all those houses and thinking how i should have to find out about the people when i was an earl
how did you find out about them
as his lordships knowledge of his tenantry consisted in finding out which of them paid their rent promptly and in turning out those who did not this was rather a hard question
newick finds out for me he said and he pulled his great gray mustache and looked at his small questioner rather uneasily
we will go home now he added and when you are an earl see to it that you are a better earl than i have been
he was very silent as they rode home
he felt it to be almost incredible that he who had never really loved any one in his life should find himself growing so fond of this little fellowas without doubt he was
at first he had only been pleased and proud of cedrics beauty and bravery but there was something more than pride in his feeling now
im an old fellow in my dotage and i have nothing else to think of he would say to himself and yet he knew it was not that altogether
it was only about a week after that ride when after a visit to his mother fauntleroy came into the library with a troubled thoughtful face
he sat down in that highbacked chair in which he had sat on the evening of his arrival and for a while he looked at the embers on the hearth
the earl watched him in silence wondering what was coming
it was evident that cedric had something on his mind
at last he looked up
does newick know all about the people
it is his business to know about them said his lordship
been neglecting ithas he
contradictory as it may seem there was nothing which entertained and edified him more than the little fellows interest in his tenantry
there is a place said fauntleroy looking up at him with wideopen horrorstricken eyedearest has seen it it is at the other end of the village
the houses are close together and almost falling down you can scarcely breathe and the people are so poor and everything is dreadful
often they have fever and the children die and it makes them wicked to live like that and be so poor and miserable
it is worse than
michael and bridget
the rain comes in at the roof
dearest went to see a poor woman who lived there
she would not let me come near her until she had changed all her things
the tears ran down her cheeks when she told me about it
the tears had come into his own eyes but he smiled through them
i told her you didnt know and i would tell you he said
he jumped down and came and leaned against the earls chair
you can make it all right he said just as you made it all right for higgins
you always make it all right for everybody
i told her you would and that newick must have forgotten to tell you
the earl looked down at the hand on his knee
newick had not forgotten to tell him in fact newick had spoken to him more than once of the desperate condition of the end of the village known as earls court
he knew all about the tumbledown miserable cottages and the bad drainage and the damp walls and broken windows and leaking roofs and all about the poverty the fever and the misery
and yet as he looked at the small hand on his knee and from the small hand to the honest earnest frankeyed face he was actually a little ashamed both of earls court and himself
he said you want to make a builder of model cottages of me do you
and he positively put his own hand upon the childish one and stroked it
those must be pulled down said fauntleroy with great eagerness
dearest says so
let uslet us go and have them pulled down tomorrow
the people will be so glad when they see you
theyll know you have come to help them
and his eyes shone like stars in his glowing face
the earl rose from his chair and put his hand on the childs shoulder
let us go out and take our walk on the terrace he said with a short laugh and we can talk it over
the truth was that mrs
errol had found a great many sad things in the course of her work among the poor of the little village that appeared so picturesque when it was seen from the moorsides
everything was not as picturesque when seen near by as it looked from a distance
she had found idleness and poverty and ignorance where there should have been comfort and industry
and she had discovered after a while that
erleboro was considered to be the worst village in that part of the country
mordaunt had told her a great many of his difficulties and discouragements and she had found out a great deal by herself
the agents who had managed the property had always been chosen to please the
earl and had cared nothing for the degradation and wretchedness of the poor tenants
many things therefore had been neglected which should have been attended to and matters had gone from bad to worse
as to earls court it was a disgrace with its dilapidated houses and miserable careless sickly people
when first mrs
errol went to the place it made her shudder
such ugliness and slovenliness and want seemed worse in a country place than in a city
it seemed as if there it might be helped
and a bold thought came in her wise little motherheart
the earl would give him anything she said to mr
he would indulge his every whim
why should not that indulgence be used for the good of others
it is for me to see that this shall come to pass
and strange as it appeared to every one good results did follow
he could not quite make up his mind to let him discover that he had no inclination to be generous at all and that he wanted his own way on all occasions whether it was right or wrong
he actually had learned to be fond enough of that small boy with the mop of yellow lovelocks to feel that he himself would prefer to be guilty of an amiable action now and then
and sothough he laughed at himselfafter some reflection he sent for
newick and had quite a long interview with him on the subject of the
court and it was decided that the wretched hovels should be pulled down and new houses should be built
it is lord fauntleroy who insists on it he said dryly he thinks it will improve the property
you can tell the tenants that its his idea
and he looked down at his small lordship who was lying on the hearthrug playing with dougal
the great dog was the lads constant companion and followed him about everywhere stalking solemnly after him when he walked and trotting majestically behind when he rode or drove
of course both the country people and the town people heard of the proposed improvement
at first many of them would not believe it but when a small army of workmen arrived and commenced pulling down the crazy squalid cottages people began to understand that little lord
fauntleroy had done them a good turn again and that through his innocent interference the scandal of earls court had at last been removed
if he had only known how they talked about him and praised him everywhere and prophesied great things for him when he grew up how astonished he would have been
but he never suspected it
hobbs who responded in characteristic fashion riding out at his grandfathers side or with wilkins as escort
they are so fond of you he once said looking up at his lordship with a bright smile
do you see how glad they are when they see you
i hope they will some day be as fond of me
it must be nice to have everybody like you
and he felt quite proud to be the grandson of so greatly admired and beloved an individual
when the cottages were being built the lad and his grandfather used to ride over to earls court together to look at them and fauntleroy was full of interest
he would dismount from his pony and go and make acquaintance with the workmen asking them questions about building and bricklaying and telling them things about america
after two or three such conversations he was able to enlighten the earl on the subject of brickmaking as they rode home
i always like to know about things like those he said because you never know what you are coming to
hes a rare un they used to say
an a noice little outspoken chap too
not much o th bad stock in him
but no one knew quite how much it had been warmed and how day by day the old man found himself caring more and more for the child who was the only creature that had ever trusted him
often as he watched the little fellow lying upon the hearth conning some big book the light shining on the bright young head his old eyes would gleam and his cheek would flush
the boy can do anything he would say to himself anything
he never spoke to any one else of his feeling for cedric when he spoke of him to others it was always with the same grim smile
do you remember cedric said once looking up from his book as he lay on the rug do you remember what i said to you that first night about our being good companions
i dont think any people could be better companions than we are do you
we are pretty good companions i should say replied his lordship
fauntleroy scrambled up and went to him
is there anything you want the earl asked anything you have not
the little fellows brown eyes fixed themselves on his grandfather with a rather wistful look
only one thing he answered
what is that
inquired the earl
fauntleroy was silent a second
he had not thought matters over to himself so long for nothing
what is it
my lord repeated
fauntleroy answered
it is dearest he said
the old earl winced a little
but you see her almost every day he said
is not that enough
i used to see her all the time said fauntleroy
she used to kiss me when i went to sleep at night and in the morning she was always there and we could tell each other things without waiting
the old eyes and the young ones looked into each other through a moment of silence
then the earl knitted his brows
do you never forget about your mother
no answered fauntleroy never and she never forgets about me
i shouldnt forget about you you know if i didnt live with you
i should think about you all the more
upon my word said the earl after looking at him a moment longer i believe you would
the jealous pang that came when the boy spoke so of his mother seemed even stronger than it had been before it was stronger because of this old mans increasing affection for the boy
but it was not long before he had other pangs so much harder to face that he almost forgot for the time he had ever hated his sons wife at all
and in a strange and startling way it happened
one evening just before the earls court cottages were completed there was a grand dinner party at dorincourt
there had not been such a party at the
castle for a long time
a few days before it took place sir harry
lorridaile and lady lorridaile who was the earls only sister actually came for a visita thing which caused the greatest excitement in the village and set mrs
dibbles shopbell tinkling madly again because it was well known that lady lorridaile had only been to dorincourt once since her marriage thirtyfive years before
she had heard a great deal of him that was not pleasant through the years in which they had been separated
those two elder sons bevis and maurice she had never seen but once there had come to
lady lorridailes kind heart had warmed through and through at the sight of the young man and she had made him stay with her a week and petted him and made much of him and admired him immensely
at last there came a rumor of his death and then
bevis had been thrown from his horse and killed and maurice had died in
rome of the fever and soon after came the story of the american child who was to be found and brought home as lord fauntleroy
probably to be ruined as the others were she said to her husband unless his mother is good enough and has a will of her own to help her to take care of him
but when she heard that cedrics mother had been parted from him she was almost too indignant for words
it is disgraceful harry
fancy a child of that age being taken from his mother and made the companion of a man like my brother
he will either be brutal to the boy or indulge him until he is a little monster
if i thought it would do any good to write it wouldnt constantia said sir harry
i know it wouldnt she answered
i know his lordship the earl of
dorincourt too wellbut it is outrageous
not only the poor people and farmers heard about little lord fauntleroy others knew him
sir thomas asshe of asshawe hall being in
erleboro one day met the earl and his grandson riding together and stopped to shake hands with my lord and congratulate him on his change of looks and on his recovery from the gout
and d ye know he said when he spoke of the incident afterward the old man looked as proud as a turkeycock and upon my word i dont wonder for a handsomer finer lad than his grandson i never saw
as straight as a dart and sat his pony like a young trooper
and just as she was wondering how it might be brought about to her utter astonishment she received a letter from her brother inviting her to come with her husband to dorincourt
it seems incredible
she exclaimed
i have heard it said that the child has worked miracles and i begin to believe it
they say my brother adores the boy and can scarcely endure to have him out of sight
and he is so proud of him
actually i believe he wants to show him to us
and she accepted the invitation at once
when she reached dorincourt castle with sir harry it was late in the afternoon and she went to her room at once before seeing her brother
having dressed for dinner she entered the drawingroom
as she shook hands with the earl she called him by the name she had not used since her girlhood
what molyneux
she said is this the child
yes constantia answered the earl this is the boy
fauntleroy this is your grandaunt lady lorridaile
how do you do grandaunt
said fauntleroy
lady lorridaile put her hand on his shoulders and after looking down into his upraised face a few seconds kissed him warmly
i am your aunt constantia she said and i loved your poor papa and you are very like him
it makes me glad when i am told i am like him answered fauntleroy because it seems as if every one liked himjust like dearest eszacklyaunt constantia adding the two words after a seconds pause
lady lorridaile was delighted
she bent and kissed him again and from that moment they were warm friends
well molyneux she said aside to the earl afterward it could not possibly be better than this
i think not answered his lordship dryly
he is a fine little fellow
we are great friends
he believes me to be the most charming and sweettempered of philanthropists
i will confess to you
constantiaas you would find it out if i did notthat i am in some slight danger of becoming rather an old fool about him
what does his mother think of you
asked lady lorridaile with her usual straightforwardness
i have not asked her answered the earl slightly scowling
well said lady lorridaile i will be frank with you at the outset
molyneux and tell you i dont approve of your course and that it is my intention to call on mrs
errol as soon as possible so if you wish to quarrel with me you had better mention it at once
what i hear of the young creature makes me quite sure that her child owes her everything
we were told even at lorridaile park that your poorer tenants adore her already
they adore him said the earl nodding toward fauntleroy
errol youll find her a pretty little woman
im rather in debt to her for giving some of her beauty to the boy and you can go to see her if you like
all i ask is that she will remain at court lodge and that you will not ask me to go and see her and he scowled a little again
but he doesnt hate her as much as he used to that is plain enough to me her ladyship said to sir harry afterward
why the child actually loves himleans on his chair and against his knee
his own children would as soon have thought of nestling up to a tiger
the very next day she went to call upon mrs
when she returned she said to her brother molyneux she is the loveliest little woman i ever saw
she has a voice like a silver bell and you may thank her for making the boy what he is
she has given him more than her beauty and you make a great mistake in not persuading her to come and take charge of you
i shall invite her to
lorridaile
shell not leave the boy replied the earl
i must have the boy too said lady lorridaile laughing
she knew too that the prime reason for the great dinner party was the
bevis and maurice were such a bitter humiliation to him she said to her husband
every one knew it
he actually hated them
his pride has full sway here
perhaps there was not one person who accepted the invitation without feeling some curiosity about little lord fauntleroy and wondering if he would be on view
and when the time came he was on view
the lad has good manners said the earl
he will be in no ones way
children are usually idiots or boresmine were bothbut he can actually answer when hes spoken to and be silent when he is not
he is never offensive
but he was not allowed to be silent very long
every one had something to say to him
the fact was they wished to make him talk
the ladies petted him and asked him questions and the men asked him questions too and joked with him as the men on the steamer had done when he crossed the atlantic
fauntleroy did not quite understand why they laughed so sometimes when he answered them but he was so used to seeing people amused when he was quite serious that he did not mind
he thought the whole evening delightful
there was one young lady who he heard them say had just come down from london where she had spent the season and she was so charming that he could not keep his eyes from her
she was a rather tall young lady with a proud little head and very soft dark hair and large eyes the color of purple pansies and the color on her cheeks and lips was like that of a rose
she was dressed in a beautiful white dress and had pearls around her throat
there was one strange thing about this young lady
so many gentlemen stood near her and seemed anxious to please her that
fauntleroy thought she must be something like a princess
he was so much interested in her that without knowing it he drew nearer and nearer to her and at last she turned and spoke to him
come here lord fauntleroy she said smiling and tell me why you look at me so
i was thinking how beautiful you are his young lordship replied
then all the gentlemen laughed outright and the young lady laughed a little too and the rose color in her cheeks brightened
ah fauntleroy said one of the gentlemen who had laughed most heartily make the most of your time
when you are older you will not have the courage to say that
but nobody could help saying it said fauntleroy sweetly
could you help it
dont you think she is pretty too
we are not allowed to say what we think said the gentleman while the rest laughed more than ever
but the beautiful young ladyher name was miss vivian herbertput out her hand and drew cedric to her side looking prettier than before if possible
lord fauntleroy shall say what he thinks she said and i am much obliged to him
i am sure he thinks what he says
and she kissed him on his cheek
i think you are prettier than any one i ever saw said fauntleroy looking at her with innocent admiring eyes except dearest
i couldnt think any one quite as pretty as dearest
i think she is the prettiest person in the world
i am sure she is said miss vivian herbert
and she laughed and kissed his cheek again
she kept him by her side a great part of the evening and the group of which they were the center was very gay
he did not know how it happened but before long he was telling them all about america and the republican rally and mr
hobbs and dick and in the end he proudly produced from his pocket dicks parting giftthe red silk handkerchief
i put it in my pocket tonight because it was a party he said
i thought dick would like me to wear it at a party
and queer as the big flaming spotted thing was there was a serious affectionate look in his eyes which prevented his audience from laughing very much
you see i like it he said because dick is my friend
but though he was talked to so much as the earl had said he was in no ones way
he could be quiet and listen when others talked and so no one found him tiresome
once he stood so near the chairs arm that his cheek touched the earls shoulder and his lordship detecting the general smile smiled a little himself
he knew what the lookerson were thinking and he felt some secret amusement in their seeing what good friends he was with this youngster who might have been expected to share the popular opinion of him
havisham had been expected to arrive in the afternoon but strange to say he was late
such a thing had really never been known to happen before during all the years in which he had been a visitor at dorincourt
he was so late that the guests were on the point of rising to go in to dinner when he arrived
when he approached his host the earl regarded him with amazement
he looked as if he had been hurried or agitated his dry keen old face was actually pale
i was detained he said in a low voice to the earl byan extraordinary event
it was as unlike the methodic old lawyer to be agitated by anything as it was to be late but it was evident that he had been disturbed
at dinner he ate scarcely anything and two or three times when he was spoken to he started as if his thoughts were far away
at dessert when fauntleroy came in he looked at him more than once nervously and uneasily
fauntleroy noted the look and wondered at it
havisham were on friendly terms and they usually exchanged smiles
the lawyer seemed to have forgotten to smile that evening
what a blow it was that he must deal them
he did not exactly know how the long superb dinner ended
he sat through it as if he were in a dream and several times he saw the earl glance at him in surprise
but it was over at last and the gentlemen joined the ladies in the drawingroom
they found fauntleroy sitting on the sofa with miss vivian
herbertthe great beauty of the last london season they had been looking at some pictures and he was thanking his companion as the door opened
im ever so much obliged to you for being so kind to me
he was saying i never was at a party before and ive enjoyed myself so much
he had enjoyed himself so much that when the gentlemen gathered about
miss herbert again and began to talk to her as he listened and tried to understand their laughing speeches his eyelids began to droop
they drooped until they covered his eyes two or three times and then the sound of miss herberts low pretty laugh would bring him back and he would open them again for about two seconds
he was quite sure he was not going to sleep but there was a large yellow satin cushion behind him and his head sank against it and after a while his eyelids drooped for the last time
they did not even quite open when as it seemed a long time after some one kissed him lightly on the cheek
it was miss
vivian herbert who was going away and she spoke to him softly
goodnight little lord fauntleroy she said
sleep well
and in the morning he did not know that he had tried to open his eyes and had murmured sleepily goodnightim sogladi saw youyou are sopretty
he only had a very faint recollection of hearing the gentlemen laugh again and of wondering why they did it
no sooner had the last guest left the room than mr
havisham turned from his place by the fire and stepped nearer the sofa where he stood looking down at the sleeping occupant
little lord fauntleroy was taking his ease luxuriously
he made a picture well worth looking at
havisham looked at it he put his hand up and rubbed his shaven chin with a harassed countenance
well havisham said the earls harsh voice behind him
what is it
it is evident something has happened
what was the extraordinary event if i may ask
havisham turned from the sofa still rubbing his chin
it was bad news he answered distressing news my lordthe worst of news
i am sorry to be the bearer of it
the earl had been uneasy for some time during the evening as he glanced at mr
havisham and when he was uneasy he was always illtempered
why do you look so at the boy
he exclaimed irritably
you have been looking at him all the evening as ifsee here now why should you look at the boy havisham and hang over him like some bird of illomen
what has your news to do with lord fauntleroy
my lord said mr
havisham i will waste no words
my news has everything to do with lord fauntleroy
and if we are to believe itit is not lord fauntleroy who lies sleeping before us but only the son of
captain errol
and the present lord fauntleroy is the son of your son
bevis and is at this moment in a lodginghouse in london
the earl clutched the arms of his chair with both his hands until the veins stood out upon them the veins stood out on his forehead too his fierce old face was almost livid
what do you mean
he cried out
you are mad
whose lie is this
if it is a lie answered mr
havisham it is painfully like the truth
a woman came to my chambers this morning
she said your son
bevis married her six years ago in london
she showed me her marriage certificate
they quarrelled a year after the marriage and he paid her to keep away from him
she has a son five years old
she is an american of the lower classesan ignorant personand until lately she did not fully understand what her son could claim
she consulted a lawyer and found out that the boy was really lord fauntleroy and the heir to the earldom of dorincourt and she of course insists on his claims being acknowledged
there was a movement of the curly head on the yellow satin cushion
a soft long sleepy sigh came from the parted lips and the little boy stirred in his sleep but not at all restlessly or uneasily
not at all as if his slumber were disturbed by the fact that he was being proved a small impostor and that he was not lord fauntleroy at all and never would be the earl of dorincourt
he only turned his rosy face more on its side as if to enable the old man who stared at it so solemnly to see it better
the handsome grim old face was ghastly
a bitter smile fixed itself upon it
i should refuse to believe a word of it he said if it were not such a low scoundrelly piece of business that it becomes quite possible in connection with the name of my son bevis
it is quite like bevis
he was always a disgrace to us
always a weak untruthful vicious young brute with low tastesmy son and heir bevis lord fauntleroy
the woman is an ignorant vulgar person you say
i am obliged to admit that she can scarcely spell her own name answered the lawyer
she is absolutely uneducated and openly mercenary
she cares for nothing but the money
she is very handsome in a coarse way but
the fastidious old lawyer ceased speaking and gave a sort of shudder
the veins on the old earls forehead stood out like purple cords
something else stood out upon it toocold drops of moisture
he took out his handkerchief and swept them away
his smile grew even more bitter
and i he said i objected toto the other woman the mother of this child pointing to the sleeping form on the sofa i refused to recognize her
and yet she could spell her own name
i suppose this is retribution
suddenly he sprang up from his chair and began to walk up and down the room
fierce and terrible words poured forth from his lips
his rage and hatred and cruel disappointment shook him as a storm shakes a tree
his violence was something dreadful to see and yet mr
havisham noticed that at the very worst of his wrath he never seemed to forget the little sleeping figure on the yellow satin cushion and that he never once spoke loud enough to awaken it
i might have known it he said
they were a disgrace to me from their first hour
i hated them both and they hated me
bevis was the worse of the two
i will not believe this yet though
i will contend against it to the last
but it is like bevisit is like him
and then he raged again and asked questions about the woman about her proofs and pacing the room turned first white and then purple in his repressed fury
when at last he had learned all there was to be told and knew the worst mr
havisham looked at him with a feeling of anxiety
he looked broken and haggard and changed
his rages had always been bad for him but this one had been worse than the rest because there had been something more than rage in it
he came slowly back to the sofa at last and stood near it
if any one had told me i could be fond of a child he said his harsh voice low and unsteady i should not have believed them
i always detested childrenmy own more than the rest
i am fond of this one he is fond of me with a bitter smile
i am not popular i never was
but he is fond of me
he never was afraid of mehe always trusted me
he would have filled my place better than i have filled it
i know that
he would have been an honor to the name
he bent down and stood a minute or so looking at the happy sleeping face
his shaggy eyebrows were knitted fiercely and yet somehow he did not seem fierce at all
he put up his hand pushed the bright hair back from the forehead and then turned away and rang the bell
when the largest footman appeared he pointed to the sofa
takehe said and then his voice changed a littletake lord
fauntleroy to his room
hobbss young friend left him to go to dorincourt castle and become lord fauntleroy and the groceryman had time to realize that the
atlantic ocean lay between himself and the small companion who had spent so many agreeable hours in his society he really began to feel very lonely indeed
the fact was mr
hobbs was not a clever man nor even a bright one he was indeed rather a slow and heavy person and he had never made many acquaintances
he was not mentally energetic enough to know how to amuse himself and in truth he never did anything of an entertaining nature but read the newspapers and add up his accounts
it was not very easy for him to add up his accounts and sometimes it took him a long time to bring them out right and in the old days little
hobbs had held such long conversations about the revolution and the
british and the elections and the republican party that it was no wonder his going left a blank in the grocery store
at first it seemed to mr
this is a hot dayisnt it
but as the days passed on and this did not happen mr
hobbs felt very dull and uneasy
he did not even enjoy his newspaper as much as he used to
he would put the paper down on his knee after reading it and sit and stare at the high stool for a long time
there were some marks on the long legs which made him feel quite dejected and melancholy
they were marks made by the heels of the next earl of dorincourt when he kicked and talked at the same time
it seems that even youthful earls kick the legs of things they sit onnoble blood and lofty lineage do not prevent it
after looking at those marks mr
hobbs would take out his gold watch and open it and stare at the inscription from his oldest friend lord fauntleroy to mr
when this you see remember me
and after staring at it awhile he would shut it up with a loud snap and sigh and get up and go and stand in the doorwaybetween the box of potatoes and the barrel of applesand look up the street
this went on for two or three weeks before any new idea came to him
being slow and ponderous it always took him a long time to reach a new idea
as a rule he did not like new ideas but preferred old ones
after two or three weeks however during which instead of getting better matters really grew worse a novel plan slowly and deliberately dawned upon him
he would go to see dick
he smoked a great many pipes before he arrived at the conclusion but finally he did arrive at it
he would go to see dick
he knew all about dick
cedric had told him and his idea was that perhaps dick might be some comfort to him in the way of talking things over
he stared at it so long that dick began to take a lively interest in him and when he had put the finishing touch to his customers boots he said want a shine sir
the stout man came forward deliberately and put his foot on the rest
yes he said
then when dick fell to work the stout man looked from dick to the sign and from the sign to dick
where did you get that
from a friend o mine said dicka little feller
he guv me the whole outfit
he was the best little feller ye ever saw
hes in england now
gone to be one o them lords
lordlord asked mr
hobbs with ponderous slowness lord
fauntleroygoin to be earl of dorincourt
dick almost dropped his brush
he exclaimed d ye know him yerself
ive known him answered mr
hobbs wiping his warm forehead ever since he was born
we was lifetime acquaintancesthats what we was
it really made him feel quite agitated to speak of it
he pulled the splendid gold watch out of his pocket and opened it and showed the inside of the case to dick
when this you see remember me he read
that was his parting keepsake to me
i dont want you to forget methose was his wordsid ha remembered him he went on shaking his head if he hadnt given me a thing an i hadnt seen hide nor hair on him again
he was a companion as any man would remember
he was the nicest little feller i ever see said dick
an as to sandi never seen so much sand to a little feller
i thought a heap o him i didan we was friends toowe was sort o chums from the fust that little young un an me
i grabbed his ball from under a stage fur him an he never forgot it an hed come down here he would with his mother or his nuss and hed holler hello dick
at me as friendly as if he was six feet high when he warnt knee high to a grasshopper and was dressed in gals cloes
he was a gay little chap and when you was down on your luck it did you good to talk to him
thats so said mr
it was a pity to make a earl out of him
he would have shone in the grocery businessor dry goods either he would have shone
and he shook his head with deeper regret than ever
it proved that they had so much to say to each other that it was not possible to say it all at one time and so it was agreed that the next night dick should make a visit to the store and keep mr
hobbs company
the plan pleased dick well enough
he had been a street waif nearly all his life but he had never been a bad boy and he had always had a private yearning for a more respectable kind of existence
since he had been in business for himself he had made enough money to enable him to sleep under a roof instead of out in the streets and he had begun to hope he might reach even a higher plane in time
so to be invited to call on a stout respectable man who owned a corner store and even had a horse and wagon seemed to him quite an event
do you know anything about earls and castles
hobbs inquired
id like to know more of the particklars
theres a story about some on em in the penny story gazette said
its called the crime of a coronet or the revenge of the
countess may
its a boss thing too
some of us boys re takin it to read
bring it up when you come said mr
hobbs an ill pay for it
bring all you can find that have any earls in em
if there arent earls markisesll do or dooksthough he never made mention of any dooks or markises
we did go over coronets a little but i never happened to see any
i guess they dont keep em round here
tiffany d have em if anybody did said dick but i dont know as
id know one if i saw it
hobbs did not explain that he would not have known one if he saw it
he merely shook his head ponderously
i spose there is very little call for em he said and that ended the matter
this was the beginning of quite a substantial friendship
when dick went up to the store mr
hobbs received him with great hospitality
he gave him a chair tilted against the door near a barrel of apples and after his young visitor was seated he made a jerk at them with the hand in which he held his pipe saying help yerself
then he looked at the story papers and after that they read and discussed the british aristocracy and mr
hobbs smoked his pipe very hard and shook his head a great deal
he shook it most when he pointed out the high stool with the marks on its legs
theres his very kicks he said impressively his very kicks
i sit and look at em by the hour
this is a world of ups an its a world of downs
why hed set there an eat crackers out of a box an apples out of a barrel an pitch his cores into the street an now hes a lord alivin in a castle
thems a lords kicks theyll be a earls kicks some day
sometimes i says to myself says i well ill be jiggered
he seemed to derive a great deal of comfort from his reflections and
dicks visit
before dick went home they had a supper in the small backroom they had crackers and cheese and sardines and other canned things out of the store and mr
hobbs solemnly opened two bottles of ginger ale and pouring out two glasses proposed a toast
heres to him
he said lifting his glass an may he teach em a lessonearls an markises an dooks an all
after that night the two saw each other often and mr
hobbs was much more comfortable and less desolate
one day mr
hobbs made a pilgrimage to a book store down town for the express purpose of adding to their library
he went to the clerk and leaned over the counter to speak to him
i want he said a book about earls
exclaimed the clerk
a book repeated the groceryman about earls
im afraid said the clerk looking rather queer that we havent what you want
hobbs anxiously
well say markises thenor dooks
i know of no such book answered the clerk
hobbs was much disturbed
he looked down on the floorthen he looked up
none about female earls
he inquired
im afraid not said the clerk with a smile
well exclaimed mr
hobbs ill be jiggered
he was just going out of the store when the clerk called him back and asked him if a story in which the nobility were chief characters would do
hobbs said it wouldif he could not get an entire volume devoted to earls
so the clerk sold him a book called the tower of
london written by mr
harrison ainsworth and he carried it home
when dick came they began to read it
it was a very wonderful and exciting book and the scene was laid in the reign of the famous english queen who is called by some people bloody mary
hobbs heard of queen marys deeds and the habit she had of chopping peoples heads off putting them to the torture and burning them alive he became very much excited
he took his pipe out of his mouth and stared at dick and at last he was obliged to mop the perspiration from his brow with his red pocket handkerchief
why he aint safe
he aint safe
if the women folks can sit up on their thrones an give the word for things like that to be done whos to know whats happening to him this very minute
hes no more safe than nothing
just let a woman like that get mad an no ones safe
well said dick though he looked rather anxious himself ye see this ere un isnt the one thats bossin things now
i know her names
victory an this un here in the book her names mary
so it is said mr
hobbs still mopping his forehead so it is
an the newspapers are not sayin anything about any racks thumbscrews or stakeburninsbut still it doesnt seem as if t was safe for him over there with those queer folks
why they tell me they dont keep the
fourth o july
but they both found great pleasure in their letters
they read and reread them and talked them over and enjoyed every word of them
and they spent days over the answers they sent and read them over almost as often as the letters they had received
it was rather a labor for dick to write his
he told mr
hobbs all about his life and about his elder brother who had been rather good to him after their mother died when dick was quite a little fellow
their father had died some time before
the brothers name was ben and he had taken care of dick as well as he could until the boy was old enough to sell newspapers and run errands
they had lived together and as he grew older ben had managed to get along until he had quite a decent place in a store
and then exclaimed dick with disgust blest if he didnt go an marry a gal
just went and got spoony an hadnt any more sense left
married her an set up housekeepin in two back rooms
an a hefty un she wasa regular tigercat
shed tear things to pieces when she got madand she was mad all the time
had a baby just like heryell day n night
an if i didnt have to tend it
an when it screamed shed fire things at me
she fired a plate at me one day an hit the baby cut its chin
doctor said hed carry the mark till he died
a nice mother she was
but didnt we have a timeben n mehself n the young un
she was mad at ben because he didnt make money faster n at last he went out west with a man to set up a cattle ranch
an hadnt been gone a week fore one night i got home from sellin my papers n the rooms wus locked up n empty n the woman o the house she told me minna d goneshown a clean pair o heels
some un else said shed gone across the water to be nuss to a lady as had a little baby too
never heard a word of her sincenuther has ben
id ha bin him i wouldnt ha fretted a bitn i guess he didnt
but he thought a heap o her at the start
tell you he was spoons on her
she was a daisylookin gal too when she was dressed up n not mad
shed big black eyes n black hair down to her knees shed make it into a rope as big as your arm and twist it round n round her head n i tell you her eyes d snap
folks used to say she was part italiunsaid her mother or father d come from there n it made her queer
i tell ye she was one of emshe was
he often told mr
hobbs stories of her and of his brother ben who since his going out west had written once or twice to dick
bens luck had not been good and he had wandered from place to place but at last he had settled on a ranch in california where he was at work at the time when dick became acquainted with mr
that gal said dick one day she took all the grit out o him
i couldnt help feelin sorry for him sometimes
they were sitting in the store doorway together and mr
hobbs was filling his pipe
he oughtnt to ve married he said solemnly as he rose to get a match
womeni never could see any use in em myself
as he took the match from its box he stopped and looked down on the counter
he said if here isnt a letter
i didnt see it before
the postman must have laid it down when i wasnt noticin or the newspaper slipped over it
he picked it up and looked at it carefully
its from him
he exclaimed
thats the very one its from
he forgot his pipe altogether
he went back to his chair quite excited and took his pocketknife and opened the envelope
i wonder what news there is this time he said
and then he unfolded the letter and read as follows dorincourt castle my dear mr
hobbs i write this in a great hury becaus i have something curous to tell you i know you will be very mutch suprised my dear frend when i tel you
the lady brought her little boy to the castle and my grandfarther and mr
hobbs fell back in his chair the letter dropped on his knee his penknife slipped to the floor and so did the envelope
he ejaculated i am jiggered
he was so dumfounded that he actually changed his exclamation
it had always been his habit to say i will be jiggered but this time he said i am jiggered
perhaps he really was jiggered
there is no knowing
well said dick the whole things bust up hasnt it
its my opinion its a putup job o the
british ristycrats to rob him of his rights because hes an american
theyve had a spite agin us ever since the revolution an theyre takin it out on him
i told you he wasnt safe an see whats happened
like as not the whole goverments got together to rob him of his lawful ownins
he was very much agitated
he might not have a good opinion of earls but he knew that even in
america money was considered rather an agreeable thing and if all the wealth and grandeur were to go with the title it must be rather hard to lose it
theyre trying to rob him
he said thats what theyre doing and folks that have money ought to look after him
a very few days after the dinner party at the castle almost everybody in england who read the newspapers at all knew the romantic story of what had happened at dorincourt
it made a very interesting story when it was told with all the details
all these things were talked about and written about and caused a tremendous sensation
and then there came the rumor that the earl of dorincourt was not satisfied with the turn affairs had taken and would perhaps contest the claim by law and the matter might end with a wonderful trial
there never had been such excitement before in the county in which
erleboro was situated
they related wonderful anecdotes about the earls rage and his determination not to acknowledge the new lord fauntleroy and his hatred of the woman who was the claimants mother
but of course it was mrs
dibble who could tell the most and who was more in demand than ever
an a bad lookout it is she said
an if you were to ask me maam
an whats more this new ones no lady as his little lordships ma is
shes a boldfaced blackeyed thing as mr
thomas says no gentleman in livery ud bemean hisself to be gave orders by and let her come into the house he says an he goes out of it
an the boy dont no more compare with the other one than nothin you could mention
an mercy knows whats goin to come of it all an where its to end an you might have knocked me down with a feather when jane brought the news
in fact there was excitement everywhere at the castle in the library where the earl and mr
havisham sat and talked in the servants hall where mr
he was a one as it were some pleasure to ride behind
but in the midst of all the disturbance there was one person who was quite calm and untroubled
that person was the little lord fauntleroy who was said not to be lord fauntleroy at all
when first the state of affairs had been explained to him he had felt some little anxiousness and perplexity it is true but its foundation was not in baffled ambition
it makes me feel very queer he said it makes me feelqueer
the earl looked at the boy in silence
it made him feel queer tooqueerer than he had ever felt in his whole life
and he felt more queer still when he saw that there was a troubled expression on the small face which was usually so happy
will they take dearests house from herand her carriage
cedric asked in a rather unsteady anxious little voice
said the earl decidedlyin quite a loud voice in fact
they can take nothing from her
said cedric with evident relief
then he looked up at his grandfather and there was a wistful shade in his eyes and they looked very big and soft
that other boy he said rather tremulouslyhe will have toto be your boy nowas i waswont he
answered the earland he said it so fiercely and loudly that
cedric quite jumped
he exclaimed in wonderment
he stood up from his stool quite suddenly
shall i be your boy even if im not going to be an earl
shall i be your boy just as i was before
and his flushed little face was all alight with eagerness
how the old earl did look at him from head to foot to be sure
how his great shaggy brows did draw themselves together and how queerly his deep eyes shone under themhow very queerly
cedrics face turned red to the roots of his hair it turned red with relief and pleasure
he put both his hands deep into his pockets and looked squarely into his noble relatives eyes
well then i dont care about the earl part at all
i dont care whether im an earl or not
i thoughtyou see i thought the one that was going to be the earl would have to be your boy too andand i couldnt be
that was what made me feel so queer
the earl put his hand on his shoulder and drew him nearer
they shall take nothing from you that i can hold for you he said drawing his breath hard
i wont believe yet that they can take anything from you
you were made for the place andwell you may fill it still
but whatever comes you shall have all that i can give youall
it scarcely seemed as if he were speaking to a child there was such determination in his face and voice it was more as if he were making a promise to himselfand perhaps he was
he had never before known how deep a hold upon him his fondness for the boy and his pride in him had taken
he had never seen his strength and good qualities and beauty as he seemed to see them now
to his obstinate nature it seemed impossiblemore than impossibleto give up what he had so set his heart upon
and he had determined that he would not give it up without a fierce struggle
within a few days after she had seen mr
havisham the woman who claimed to be lady fauntleroy presented herself at the castle and brought her child with her
she was sent away
the earl would not see her she was told by the footman at the door his lawyer would attend to her case
it was thomas who gave the message and who expressed his opinion of her freely afterward in the servants hall
he hoped he said as he had wore livery in igh famblies long enough to know a lady when he see one an if that was a lady he was no judge o females
the one at the lodge added thomas loftily merican or no merican shes one o the right sort as any gentleman ud reckinize with all a heye
i remarked it myself to henery when fust we called there
the woman drove away the look on her handsome common face half frightened half fierce
it was as if she had not expected to meet with such opposition
she is evidently the lawyer said to mrs
errol a person from the lower walks of life
she is uneducated and untrained in everything and quite unused to meeting people like ourselves on any terms of equality
she does not know what to do
her visit to the castle quite cowed her
she was infuriated but she was cowed
the earl would not receive her but i advised him to go with me to the dorincourt arms where she is staying
when she saw him enter the room she turned white though she flew into a rage at once and threatened and demanded in one breath
the fact was that the earl had stalked into the room and stood looking like a venerable aristocratic giant staring at the woman from under his beetling brows and not condescending a word
he simply stared at her taking her in from head to foot as if she were some repulsive curiosity
he let her talk and demand until she was tired without himself uttering a word and then he said you say you are my eldest sons wife
if that is true and if the proof you offer is too much for us the law is on your side
in that case your boy is lord fauntleroy
the matter will be sifted to the bottom you may rest assured
if your claims are proved you will be provided for
i want to see nothing of either you or the child so long as i live
the place will unfortunately have enough of you after my death
you are exactly the kind of person i should have expected my son bevis to choose
and then he turned his back upon her and stalked out of the room as he had stalked into it
not many days after that a visitor was announced to mrs
errol who was writing in her little morning room
the maid who brought the message looked rather excited her eyes were quite round with amazement in fact and being young and inexperienced she regarded her mistress with nervous sympathy
its the earl hisself maam
she said in tremulous awe
errol entered the drawingroom a very tall majesticlooking old man was standing on the tigerskin rug
he had a handsome grim old face with an aquiline profile a long white mustache and an obstinate look
errol i believe
errol she answered
i am the earl of dorincourt he said
he paused a moment almost unconsciously to look into her uplifted eyes
they were so like the big affectionate childish eyes he had seen uplifted to his own so often every day during the last few months that they gave him a quite curious sensation
the boy is very like you he said abruptly
it has been often said so my lord she replied but i have been glad to think him like his father also
as lady lorridaile had told him her voice was very sweet and her manner was very simple and dignified
she did not seem in the least troubled by his sudden coming
yes said the earl he is likemy sontoo
he put his hand up to his big white mustache and pulled it fiercely
do you know he said why i have come here
i have seen mr
havisham mrs
errol began and he has told me of the claims which have been made i have come to tell you said the earl that they will be investigated and contested if a contest can be made
i have come to tell you that the boy shall be defended with all the power of the law
his rights
the soft voice interrupted him
he must have nothing that is not his by right even if the law can give it to him she said
unfortunately the law can not said the earl
if it could it should
this outrageous woman and her child perhaps she cares for him as much as i care for cedric my lord said little mrs
and if she was your eldest sons wife her son is
lord fauntleroy and mine is not
she was no more afraid of him than cedric had been and she looked at him just as cedric would have looked and he having been an old tyrant all his life was privately pleased by it
people so seldom dared to differ from him that there was an entertaining novelty in it
i suppose he said scowling slightly that you would much prefer that he should not be the earl of dorincourt
her fair young face flushed
it is a very magnificent thing to be the earl of dorincourt my lord she said
i know that but i care most that he should be what his father wasbrave and just and true always
in striking contrast to what his grandfather was eh
said his lordship sardonically
i have not had the pleasure of knowing his grandfather replied mrs
errol but i know my little boy believes she stopped short a moment looking quietly into his face and then she added i know that
cedric loves you
would he have loved me said the earl dryly if you had told him why
i did not receive you at the castle
no answered mrs
errol i think not
that was why i did not wish him to know
well said my lord brusquely there are few women who would not have told him
he suddenly began to walk up and down the room pulling his great mustache more violently than ever
yes he is fond of me he said and i am fond of him
i cant say i ever was fond of anything before
i am fond of him
he pleased me from the first
i am an old man and was tired of my life
he has given me something to live for
i am proud of him
i was satisfied to think of his taking his place some day as the head of the family
he came back and stood before mrs
i am miserable he said
he looked as if he was
even his pride could not keep his voice steady or his hands from shaking
for a moment it almost seemed as if his deep fierce eyes had tears in them
perhaps it is because i am miserable that i have come to you he said quite glaring down at her
i used to hate you i have been jealous of you
this wretched disgraceful business has changed that
after seeing that repulsive woman who calls herself the wife of my son bevis i actually felt it would be a relief to look at you
i have been an obstinate old fool and i suppose i have treated you badly
you are like the boy and the boy is the first object in my life
i am miserable and i came to you merely because you are like the boy and he cares for you and i care for him
treat me as well as you can for the boys sake
he said it all in his harsh voice and almost roughly but somehow he seemed so broken down for the time that mrs
errol was touched to the heart
she got up and moved an armchair a little forward
i wish you would sit down she said in a soft pretty sympathetic way
you have been so much troubled that you are very tired and you need all your strength
it was just as new to him to be spoken to and cared for in that gentle simple way as it was to be contradicted
he was reminded of the boy again and he actually did as she asked him
perhaps his disappointment and wretchedness were good discipline for him if he had not been wretched he might have continued to hate her but just at present he found her a little soothing
almost anything would have seemed pleasant by contrast with lady fauntleroy and this one had so sweet a face and voice and a pretty dignity when she spoke or moved
very soon through the quiet magic of these influences he began to feel less gloomy and then he talked still more
whatever happens he said the boy shall be provided for
he shall be taken care of now and in the future
before he went away he glanced around the room
do you like the house
he demanded
very much she answered
this is a cheerful room he said
may i come here again and talk this matter over
as often as you wish my lord she replied
and then he went out to his carriage and drove away thomas and henry almost stricken dumb upon the box at the turn affairs had taken
of course as soon as the story of lord fauntleroy and the difficulties of the earl of dorincourt were discussed in the english newspapers they were discussed in the american newspapers
the story was too interesting to be passed over lightly and it was talked of a great deal
there were so many versions of it that it would have been an edifying thing to buy all the papers and compare them
hobbs read so much about it that he became quite bewildered
earls heir
then came the descriptions of the new lord fauntleroy and his mother
hobbs used to read the papers until his head was in a whirl and in the evening he and dick would talk it all over
seems like somethin orter be done said mr
things like them orter be held on toearls or no earls
but there really was nothing they could do but each write a letter to
cedric containing assurances of their friendship and sympathy
they wrote those letters as soon as they could after receiving the news and after having written them they handed them over to each other to be read
this is what mr
hobbs read in dicks letter dere frend i got ure letter an mr
hobbs got his an we are sory u are down on ure luck an we say hold on as longs u kin an dont let no one git ahed of u
there is a lot of ole theves wil make al they kin of u ef u dont kepe ure i skined
but this is mosly to say that ive not forgot wot u did fur me an if there aint no better way cum over here an go in pardners with me
biznes is fine an ile see no harm cums to u enny big feler that trise to cum it over u wil hafter setle it fust with
perfessor dick tipton
so no more at present dick
and this was what dick read in mr
hobbss letter dear sir yrs received and wd say things looks bad
i believe its a put up job and them thats done it ought to be looked after sharp
i write to say is two things
im going to look this thing up
well said mr
hobbs hes pervided for between us if he aint a earl
so he is said dick
id ha stood by him
blest if i didnt like that little feller fustrate
the very next morning one of dicks customers was rather surprised
he was a young lawyer just beginning practiceas poor as a very young lawyer can possibly be but a bright energetic young fellow with sharp wit and a good temper
he had a shabby office near dicks stand and every morning dick blacked his boots for him and quite often they were not exactly watertight but he always had a friendly word or a joke for
that particular morning when he put his foot on the rest he had an illustrated paper in his handan enterprising paper with pictures in it of conspicuous people and things
he had just finished looking it over and when the last boot was polished he handed it over to the boy
heres a paper for you dick he said you can look it over when you drop in at delmonicos for your breakfast
picture of an english castle in it and an english earls daughterinlaw
fine young woman toolots of hairthough she seems to be raising rather a row
you ought to become familiar with the nobility and gentry dick
begin on the right honorable the earl of dorincourt and lady fauntleroy
i say whats the matter
the pictures he spoke of were on the front page and dick was staring at one of them with his eyes and mouth open and his sharp face almost pale with excitement
whats to pay dick
said the young man
what has paralyzed you
dick really did look as if something tremendous had happened
he pointed to the picture under which was written mother of claimant lady fauntleroy
it was the picture of a handsome woman with large eyes and heavy braids of black hair wound around her head
my i know her better n i know you
the young man began to laugh
where did you meet her dick
at newport
or when you ran over to paris the last time
dick actually forgot to grin
he began to gather his brushes and things together as if he had something to do which would put an end to his business for the present
never mind he said
i know her
an ive struck work for this mornin
and in less than five minutes from that time he was tearing through the streets on his way to mr
hobbs and the corner store
hobbs could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses when he looked across the counter and saw dick rush in with the paper in his hand
the boy was out of breath with running so much out of breath in fact that he could scarcely speak as he threw the paper down on the counter
exclaimed mr
what you got there
look at it
panted dick
look at that woman in the picture
thats what you look at
she aint no ristocrat she aint
with withering scorn
shes no lords wife
you may eat me if it aint minnaminna
id know her anywheres an so d ben
jest ax him
hobbs dropped into his seat
i knowed it was a putup job he said
i knowed it and they done it on account o him bein a merican
cried dick with disgust
she done it thats who done it
she was allers up to her tricks an ill tell yer wot come to me the minnit i saw her pictur
there was one o them papers we saw had a letter in it that said somethin bout her boy an it said he had a scar on his chin
put them two togetherher n that there scar
why that there boy o hers aint no more a lord than i am
its bens boythe little chap she hit when she let fly that plate at me
professor dick tipton had always been a sharp boy and earning his living in the streets of a big city had made him still sharper
he had learned to keep his eyes open and his wits about him and it must be confessed he enjoyed immensely the excitement and impatience of that moment
hobbs was almost overwhelmed by his sense of responsibility and
dick was all alive and full of energy
he began to write a letter to
ben and he cut out the picture and inclosed it to him and mr
hobbs wrote a letter to cedric and one to the earl
they were in the midst of this letterwriting when a new idea came to dick
say he said the feller that give me the paper hes a lawyer
lets ax him what wed better do
lawyers knows it all
hobbs was immensely impressed by this suggestion and dicks business capacity
he replied
this here calls for lawyers
and leaving the store in the care of a substitute he struggled into his coat and marched downtown with dick and the two presented themselves with their romantic story in mr
harrisons office much to that young mans astonishment
and said mr
hobbs say what your times worth a hour and look into this thing thorough and ill pay the damagesilas hobbs corner of
blank street vegetables and fancy groceries
well said mr
harrison it will be a big thing if it turns out all right and it will be almost as big a thing for me as for lord
fauntleroy and at any rate no harm can be done by investigating
it appears there has been some dubiousness about the child
the woman contradicted herself in some of her statements about his age and aroused suspicion
the first persons to be written to are dicks brother and the earl of dorincourts family lawyer
and the first was addressed to t
havisham esq
and the second to benjamin tipton
and after the store was closed that evening mr
hobbs and dick sat in the backroom and talked together until midnight
it is astonishing how short a time it takes for very wonderful things to happen
it had taken only a few minutes apparently to change all the fortunes of the little boy dangling his red legs from the high stool in mr
hobbss store and to transform him from a small boy living the simplest life in a quiet street into an english nobleman the heir to an earldom and magnificent wealth
it had taken only a few minutes apparently to change him from an english nobleman into a penniless little impostor with no right to any of the splendors he had been enjoying
and surprising as it may appear it did not take nearly so long a time as one might have expected to alter the face of everything again and to give back to him all that he had been in danger of losing
it took the less time because after all the woman who had called herself lady fauntleroy was not nearly so clever as she was wicked and when she had been closely pressed by mr
all the mistakes she made were about her child
there seemed no doubt that she had been married to bevis lord fauntleroy and had quarreled with him and had been paid to keep away from him but mr
hobbss letters also
what an evening it was when those letters arrived and when mr
havisham and the earl sat and talked their plans over in the library
after my first three meetings with her said mr
havisham i began to suspect her strongly
it appeared to me that the child was older than she said he was and she made a slip in speaking of the date of his birth and then tried to patch the matter up
the story these letters bring fits in with several of my suspicions
our best plan will be to cable at once for these two tiptonssay nothing about them to herand suddenly confront her with them when she is not expecting it
she is only a very clumsy plotter after all
my opinion is that she will be frightened out of her wits and will betray herself on the spot
and that was what actually happened
she was told nothing and mr
but one fine morning as she sat in her sittingroom at the inn called the dorincourt arms making some very fine plans for herself mr
havisham was announced and when he entered he was followed by no less than three personsone was a sharpfaced boy and one was a big young man and the third was the earl of dorincourt
she sprang to her feet and actually uttered a cry of terror
it broke from her before she had time to check it
she had thought of these newcomers as being thousands of miles away when she had ever thought of them at all which she had scarcely done for years
she had never expected to see them again
it must be confessed that dick grinned a little when he saw her
hello minna
the big young manwho was benstood still a minute and looked at her
do you know her
havisham asked glancing from one to the other
yes said ben
i know her and she knows me
and he turned his back on her and went and stood looking out of the window as if the sight of her was hateful to him as indeed it was
then the woman seeing herself so baffled and exposed lost all control over herself and flew into such a rage as ben and dick had often seen her in before
dick grinned a trifle more as he watched her and heard the names she called them all and the violent threats she made but ben did not turn to look at her
i can swear to her in any court he said to mr
havisham and i can bring a dozen others who will
her father is a respectable sort of man though hes low down in the world
her mother was just like herself
shes dead but hes alive and hes honest enough to be ashamed of her
hell tell you who she is and whether she married me or not
then he clenched his hand suddenly and turned on her
wheres the child
he demanded
hes going with me
he is done with you and so am i
and just as he finished saying the words the door leading into the bedroom opened a little and the boy probably attracted by the sound of the loud voices looked in
he was not a handsome boy but he had rather a nice face and he was quite like ben his father as any one could see and there was the threecornered scar on his chin
ben walked up to him and took his hand and his own was trembling
yes he said i could swear to him too
tom he said to the little fellow im your father ive come to take you away
wheres your hat
the boy pointed to where it lay on a chair
it evidently rather pleased him to hear that he was going away
he had been so accustomed to queer experiences that it did not surprise him to be told by a stranger that he was his father
ben took up the hat and marched to the door
if you want me again he said to mr
havisham you know where to find me
he walked out of the room holding the childs hand and not looking at the woman once
she was fairly raving with fury and the earl was calmly gazing at her through his eyeglasses which he had quietly placed upon his aristocratic eagle nose
come come my young woman said mr
this wont do at all
if you dont want to be locked up you really must behave yourself
we shall have no more trouble with her said mr
and he was right for that very night she left the dorincourt arms and took the train to london and was seen no more
when the earl left the room after the interview he went at once to his carriage
to court lodge he said to thomas
to court lodge said thomas to the coachman as he mounted the box an you may depend on it things are taking a uniggspected turn
when the carriage stopped at court lodge cedric was in the drawingroom with his mother
the earl came in without being announced
he looked an inch or so taller and a great many years younger
his deep eyes flashed
where he said is lord fauntleroy
errol came forward a flush rising to her cheek
is it lord fauntleroy
is it indeed
the earl put out his hand and grasped hers
yes he answered it is
then he put his other hand on cedrics shoulder
fauntleroy he said in his unceremonious authoritative way ask your mother when she will come to us at the castle
fauntleroy flung his arms around his mothers neck
to live with us
to live with us always
the earl looked at mrs
errol and mrs
errol looked at the earl
his lordship was entirely in earnest
he had made up his mind to waste no time in arranging this matter
he had begun to think it would suit him to make friends with his heirs mother
are you quite sure you want me
errol with her soft pretty smile
quite sure he said bluntly
we have always wanted you but we were not exactly aware of it
we hope you will come
ben took his boy and went back to his cattle ranch in california and he returned under very comfortable circumstances
just before his going
but dick and mr
hobbswho had actually come over with the others to see that things were properly looked afterdid not return for some time
it had been decided at the outset that the earl would provide for
dick and would see that he received a solid education and mr
hobbs had decided that as he himself had left a reliable substitute in charge of his store he could afford to wait to see the festivities which were to celebrate lord fauntleroys eighth birthday
all the tenantry were invited and there were to be feasting and dancing and games in the park and bonfires and fireworks in the evening
just like the fourth of july
said lord fauntleroy
it seems a pity my birthday wasnt on the fourth doesnt it
for then we could keep them both together
it must be confessed that at first the earl and mr
hobbs were not as intimate as it might have been hoped they would become in the interests of the british aristocracy
the fact was that the earl had known very few grocerymen and mr
hobbs had not had many very close acquaintances who were earls and so in their rare interviews conversation did not flourish
it must also be owned that mr
hobbs had been rather overwhelmed by the splendors fauntleroy felt it his duty to show him
the entrance gate and the stone lions and the avenue impressed mr
but it was the picture gallery which seemed to be the finishing stroke
somethin in the manner of a museum
he said to fauntleroy when he was led into the great beautiful room
said fauntleroy rather doubtfully
i dont think its a museum
my grandfather says these are my ancestors
your aunts sisters
ejaculated mr
your greatuncle he must have had a family
did he raise em all
he found it necessary in fact to call in the assistance of mrs
mellon who knew all about the pictures and could tell who painted them and when and who added romantic stories of the lords and ladies who were the originals
and they was all earls
he would say er pretty nigh it
an hes goin to be one of em an own it all
at any rate one day he uttered a very remarkable and unexpected sentiment i wouldnt have minded bein one of em myself
he saidwhich was really a great concession
what a grand day it was when little lord fauntleroys birthday arrived and how his young lordship enjoyed it
how beautiful the park looked filled with the thronging people dressed in their gayest and best and with the flags flying from the tents and the top of the castle
nobody had staid away who could possibly come because everybody was really glad that little lord fauntleroy was to be little lord fauntleroy still and some day was to be the master of everything
every one wanted to have a look at him and at his pretty kind mother who had made so many friends
what scores and scores of people there were under the trees and in the tents and on the lawns
farmers and farmers wives in their sunday suits and bonnets and shawls girls and their sweethearts children frolicking and chasing about and old dames in red cloaks gossiping together
at the castle there were ladies and gentlemen who had come to see the fun and to congratulate the earl and to meet mrs
lady lorredaile and sir harry were there and sir thomas asshe and his daughters and mr
havisham of course and then beautiful miss vivian
herbert with the loveliest white gown and lace parasol and a circle of gentlemen to take care of herthough she evidently liked fauntleroy better than all of them put together
dear little boy
i am so glad
i am so glad
and afterward she walked about the grounds with him and let him show her everything
and when he took her to where mr
hobbs and dick were and said to her this is my old old friend mr
hobbs miss herbert and this is my other old friend dick
hobbs and dick liked her so much
well said dick solemnly afterward shes the daisiest gal i ever saw
sheswell shes just a daisy thats what she is n no mistake
everybody looked after her as she passed and every one looked after little lord fauntleroy
and the sun shone and the flags fluttered and the games were played and the dances danced and as the gayeties went on and the joyous afternoon passed his little lordship was simply radiantly happy
the whole world seemed beautiful to him
there was some one else who was happy tooan old man who though he had been rich and noble all his life had not often been very honestly happy
perhaps indeed i shall tell you that i think it was because he was rather better than he had been that he was rather happier
and every day he had been more pleased with his sons wife
it was true as the people said that he was beginning to like her too
english castle
it was really a very simple thing after allit was only that he had lived near a kind and gentle heart and had been taught to think kind thoughts always and to care for others
it is a very little thing perhaps but it is the best thing of all
he knew nothing of earls and castles he was quite ignorant of all grand and splendid things but he was always lovable because he was simple and loving
to be so is like being born a king
hobbs or standing near his mother or miss herbert listening to their conversation the old nobleman was very well satisfied with him
and he had never been better satisfied than he was when they went down to the biggest tent where the more important tenants of the dorincourt estate were sitting down to the grand collation of the day
they were drinking toasts and after they had drunk the health of the
earl with much more enthusiasm than his name had ever been greeted with before they proposed the health of little lord fauntleroy
and if there had ever been any doubt at all as to whether his lordship was popular or not it would have been settled that instant
such a clamor of voices and such a rattle of glasses and applause
they had begun to like him so much those warmhearted people that they forgot to feel any restraint before the ladies and gentlemen from the castle who had come to see them
little lord fauntleroy was delighted
he stood and smiled and made bows and flushed rosy red with pleasure up to the roots of his bright hair
is it because they like me dearest
he said to his mother
im so glad
and then the earl put his hand on the childs shoulder and said to him fauntleroy say to them that you thank them for their kindness
fauntleroy gave a glance up at him and then at his mother
he asked just a trifle shyly and she smiled and so did miss
herbert and they both nodded
and so he made a little step forward and everybody looked at himsuch a beautiful innocent little fellow he was too with his brave trustful face
and he spoke as loudly as he could his childish voice ringing out quite clear and strong
im ever so much obliged to you
and amid the shouts and clamor of applause he stepped back with a little sigh of relief and put his hand into the earls and stood close to him smiling and leaning against his side
and that would be the very end of my story but i must add one curious piece of information which is that mr
castle and consequently was a great success
and though he and the
not to live there he said
not to live there i want to be near him an sort o look after him
its a good enough country for them thats young an stirrinbut theres faults in it
theres not an auntsister among emnor an earl
