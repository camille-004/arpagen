introduction
unassuming in plot and style heidi may none the less lay claim to rank as a world classic
in the first place both background and characters ring true
the air of the alps is wafted to us in every page the house among the pines the meadows and the eagle poised above the naked rocks form a picture that no one could willingly forget
and the people from the kindly townsfolk to the quaint and touching peasant types are as real as any representation of human nature need be
every goat even has its personality
as for the little heroine she is a blessing not only to everyone in the story but to everyone who reads it
the narrative merits of the book are too apparent to call for comment
as to the author johanna spyri she has so entirely lost herself in her creation that we may pass over her career rather rapidly
she was born in switzerland in came of a literary family and devoted all her talent to the writing of books for and about children
since heidi has been so often translated into english it may well be asked why there is any need for a new version
the answer lies partly in the conventional character of the previous translations
now if there is any quality in heidi that gives it a particular charm that quality is freshness absolute spontaneity
to be sure the story is so attractive that it could never be wholly spoiled but has not the reader the right to enjoy it in english at least very nearly as much as he could in german
the two languages are so different in nature that anything like a literal rendering of one into the other is sure to result in awkwardness and indirectness
such a book must be not translated but relived and recreated
the translator of the present version was born and reared in a region closely similar to that of the story
her home was originally in the picturesque town of salzburg and her father franz von pausinger was one of the greatest landscape painters of his country and generation
another equally important requisite is knowledge of children
it happens that this translator has a daughter just the age of the heroine who moreover loves to dress in tyrolese costume
to translate heidi was for her therefore a labor of love which means that the love contended with and overcame the labor
the english style of the present version is then distinctive
it has often been noticed that those who acquire a foreign language often learn to speak it with unusual clearness and purity
for illustration we need go no further than joseph conrad a pole probably the greatest master of narrative english writing today or to our own fellowcitizen carl schurz
in the present case the writer has lived seven years in america and has strengthened an excellent training with a wide reading of the best english classics
many people say that they read without noticing the authors style
this is seldom quite true unconsciously every one is impressed in some way or other by the style of every book or by its lack of style
children are particularly sensitive in this respect and should therefore as much as is practicable read only the best
the phrasing has also been carefully adapted to the purpose of reading alouda thing that few translators think of
in conclusion the author realising the difference between the two languages has endeavored to write the story afresh as johanna spyri would have written it had
english been her native tongue
how successful the attempt has been the reader will judge

waving her hand and looking after her departing friend till he looked no bigger than a little dot frontispiece
she undid the heavy shawl and the two little dresses
here a neat little bed was prepared
she handed him also the whole slice of cheese
off they started at such a pace that heidi shouted for joy
when heidi heard that she struggled to get free
off they started and soon heidi was pulling the doorbell
there she would remain eating her heart away with longing
throwing herself in her grandfathers arms she held him tight
with heidis hand in his they wandered down together
they are coming oh the doctor is coming first
the two children were already flying down the alp
he watched his fallen enemy tumbling downwards downwards
peter shot off and rushed down the mountainside turning wild somersaults on his perilous way
heidis years of learning and travel illustration
going up to the almuncle
the little old town of mayenfeld is charmingly situated
from it a footpath leads through green wellwooded stretches to the foot of the heights which look down imposingly upon the valley
where the footpath begins to go steeply and abruptly up the alps the heath with its short grass and pungent herbage at once sends out its soft perfume to meet the wayfarer
one bright sunny morning in june a tall vigorous maiden of the mountain region climbed up the narrow path leading a little girl by the hand
the youngsters cheeks were in such a glow that it showed even through her sunbrowned skin
small wonder though
for in spite of the heat the little one who was scarcely five years old was bundled up as if she had to brave a bitter frost
her shape was difficult to distinguish for she wore two dresses if not three and around her shoulders a large red cotton shawl
with her feet encased in heavy hobnailed boots this hot and shapeless little person toiled up the mountain
the pair had been climbing for about an hour when they reached a hamlet halfway up the great mountain named the alm
this hamlet was called im drfli or the little village
it was the elder girls home town and therefore she was greeted from nearly every house people called to her from windows and doors and very often from the road
but answering questions and calls as she went by the girl did not loiter on her way and only stood still when she reached the end of the hamlet
there a few cottages lay scattered about from the furthest of which a voice called out to her through an open door deta please wait one moment
i am coming with you if you are going further up
when the girl stood still to wait the child instantly let go her hand and promptly sat down on the ground
are you tired heidi
deta asked the child
no but hot she replied
we shall be up in an hour if you take big steps and climb with all your little might
thus the elder girl tried to encourage her small companion
a stout pleasantlooking woman stepped out of the house and joined the two
the child had risen and wandered behind the old acquaintances who immediately started gossiping about their friends in the neighborhood and the people of the hamlet generally
where are you taking the child deta
asked the newcomer
is she the child your sister left
yes deta assured her i am taking her up to the almuncle and there i want her to remain
you cant really mean to take her there deta
you must have lost your senses to go to him
i am sure the old man will show you the door and wont even listen to what you say
as hes her grandfather it is high time he should do something for the child
i have taken care of her until this summer and now a good place has been offered to me
the child shall not hinder me from accepting it i tell you that
it would not be so hard if he were like other mortals
but you know him yourself
how could he look after a child especially such a little one
shell never get along with him i am sure of that
but tell me of your prospects
i am going to a splendid house in frankfurt
last summer some people went off to the baths and i took care of their rooms
as they got to like me they wanted to take me along but i could not leave
they have come back now and have persuaded me to go with them
i am glad i am not the child
exclaimed barbara with a shudder
nobody knows anything about the old mans life up there
he doesnt speak to a living soul and from one years end to the other he keeps away from church
people get out of his way when he appears once in a twelvemonth down here among us
we all fear him and he is really just like a heathen or an old indian with those thick grey eyebrows and that huge uncanny beard
when he wanders along the road with his twisted stick we are all afraid to meet him alone
that is not my fault said deta stubbornly
he wont do her any harm and if he should he is responsible not i
i wish i knew what weighs on the old mans conscience
why are his eyes so fierce and why does he live up there all alone
nobody ever sees him and we hear many strange things about him
didnt your sister tell you anything deta
of course she did but i shall hold my tongue
he would make me pay for it if i didnt
barbara had long been anxious to know something about the old uncle and why he lived apart from everybody
nobody had a good word for him and when people talked about him they did not speak openly but as if they were afraid
she could not even explain to herself why he was called the almuncle
he could not possibly be the uncle of all the people in the village but since everybody spoke of him so she did the same
barbara who had only lived in the village since her marriage was glad to get some information from her friend
deta had been bred there but since her mothers death had gone away to earn her livelihood
she confidentially seized detas arm and said i wish you would tell me the truth about him deta you know it allpeople only gossip
tell me what has happened to the old man to turn everybody against him so
did he always hate his fellowcreatures
i cannot tell you whether he always did and that for a very good reason
he being sixty years old and i only twentysix you cant expect me to give you an account of his early youth
but if youll promise to keep it to yourself and not set all the people in prtiggan talking i can tell you a good deal
my mother and he both came from
how can you talk like that deta
replied barbara in an offended tone
people do not gossip much in prtiggan and i always can keep things to myself if i have to
you wont repent of having told me i assure you
all right but keep your word
said deta warningly
then she looked around to see that the child was not so close to them as to overhear what might be said but the little girl was nowhere to be seen
while the two young women had talked at such a rate they had not noticed her absence quite a while must have elapsed since the little girl had given up following her companions
deta standing still looked about her everywhere but no one was on the path whichexcept for a few curveswas visible as far down as the village
there she is
cant you see her there
exclaimed barbara pointing to a spot a good distance from the path
she is climbing up with the goatherd peter and his goats
i wonder why he is so late today
i must say it suits us well enough he can look after the child while you tell me everything without being interrupted
it will be very easy for peter to watch her remarked deta she is bright for her five years and keeps her eyes wide open
i have often noticed that and i am glad for her for it will be useful with the uncle
he has nothing left in the whole wide world but his cottage and two goats
did he once have more
asked barbara
i should say so
he was heir to a large farm in domleschg
but setting up to play the fine gentleman he soon lost everything with drink and play
his parents died with grief and he himself disappeared from these parts
after many years he came back with a halfgrown boy his son tobias that was his name became a carpenter and turned out to be a quiet steady fellow
many strange rumors went round about the uncle and i think that was why he left domleschg for
we acknowledged relationship my mothers grandmother being a cousin of his
we called him uncle and because we are related on my fathers side to nearly all the people in the hamlet they too all called him uncle
he was named almuncle when he moved up to the
but what happened to tobias
asked barbara eagerly
how can i tell you everything at once
exclaimed deta
tobias was an apprentice in mels and when he was made master he came home to the village and married my sister adelheid
they always had been fond of each other and they lived very happily as man and wife
but their joy was short
two years afterwards when tobias was helping to build a house a beam fell on him and killed him
adelheid was thrown into a violent fever with grief and fright and never recovered from it
she had never been strong and had often suffered from queer spells when we did not know whether she was awake or asleep
only a few weeks after tobiass death they buried poor
people said that heaven had punished the uncle for his misdeeds
after the death of his son he never spoke to a living soul
suddenly he moved up to the alp to live there at enmity with god and man
my mother and i took adelheids little yearold baby heidi to live with us
when i went to ragatz i took her with me but in the spring the family whose work i had done last year came from frankfurt and resolved to take me to their townhouse
i am very glad to get such a good position
and now you want to hand over the child to this terrible old man
i really wonder how you can do it deta
said barbara with reproach in her voice
it seems to me i have really done enough for the child
i do not know where else to take her as she is too young to come with me to
by the way barbara where are you going
we are halfway up the alm already
deta shook hands with her companion and stood still while barbara approached the tiny darkbrown mountain hut which lay in a hollow a few steps away from the path
situated halfway up the alm the cottage was luckily protected from the mighty winds
had it been exposed to the tempests it would have been a doubtful habitation in the state of decay it was in
even as it was the doors and windows rattled and the old rafters shook when the south wind swept the mountain side
if the hut had stood on the alm top the wind would have blown it down the valley without much ado when the storm season came
here lived peter the goatherd a boy eleven years old who daily fetched the goats from the village and drove them up the mountain to the short and luscious grasses of the pastures
peter raced down in the evening with the lightfooted little goats
when he whistled sharply through his fingers every owner would come and get his or her goat
these owners were mostly small boys and girls and as the goats were friendly they did not fear them
that was the only time peter spent with other children the rest of the day the animals were his sole companions
at home lived his mother and an old blind grandmother but he only spent enough time in the hut to swallow his bread and milk for breakfast and the same repast for supper
after that he sought his bed to sleep
he always left early in the morning and at night he came home late so that he could be with his friends as long as possible
his father had met with an accident some years ago he also had been called peter the goatherd
his mother whose name was brigida was called goatherd peters wife and his blind grandmother was called by young and old from many miles about just grandmother
deta waited about ten minutes to see if the children were coming up behind with the goats
as she could not find them anywhere she climbed up a little higher to get a better view down the valley from there and peered from side to side with marks of great impatience on her countenance
the children in the meantime were ascending slowly in a zigzag way
peter always knowing where to find all sorts of good grazing places for his goats where they could nibble
thus they strayed from side to side
the poor little girl had followed the boy only with the greatest effort and she was panting in her heavy clothes
she was so hot and uncomfortable that she only climbed by exerting all her strength
she did not say anything but looked enviously at peter who jumped about so easily in his light trousers and bare feet
she envied even more the goats that climbed over bushes stones and steep inclines with their slender legs
suddenly sitting down on the ground the child swiftly took off her shoes and stockings
getting up she undid the heavy shawl and the two little dresses
out she slipped without more ado and stood up in only a light petticoat
in sheer delight at the relief she threw up her dimpled arms that were bare up to her short sleeves
to save the trouble of carrying them her aunt had dressed her in her sunday clothes over her workday garments
heidi arranged her dresses neatly in a heap and joined peter and the goats
she was now as lightfooted as any of them
when peter who had not paid much attention saw her suddenly in her light attire he grinned
looking back he saw the little heap of dresses on the ground and then he grinned yet more till his mouth seemed to reach from ear to ear but he said never a word
the child feeling free and comfortable started to converse with
peter and he had to answer many questions
she asked him how many goats he had and where he led them what he did with them when he got there and so forth
illustration she undid the heavy shawl and the two little dresses
at last the children reached the summit in front of the hut
when deta saw the little party of climbers she cried out shrilly heidi what have you done
what a sight you are
where are your dresses and your shawl
are the new shoes gone that i just bought for you and the new stockings that i made myself
where are they all heidi
the child quietly pointed down and said there
the aunt followed the direction of her finger and descried a little heap with a small red dot in the middle which she recognized as the shawl
unlucky child
deta said excitedly
what does all this mean
why have you taken your things all off
because i do not need them said the child not seeming in the least repentant of her deed
how can you be so stupid heidi
have you lost your senses
the aunt went on in a tone of mingled vexation and reproach
who do you think will go way down there to fetch those things up again
it is halfanhours walk
please peter run down and get them
do not stand and stare at me as if you were glued to the spot
i am late already replied peter and stood without moving from the place where with his hands in his trousers pockets he had witnessed the violent outbreak of heidis aunt
there you are standing and staring but that wont get you further said deta
ill give you this if you go down
with that she held a fivepennypiece under his eyes
that made peter start and in a great hurry he ran down the straightest path
he arrived again in so short a time that deta had to praise him and gave him her little coin without delay
he did not often get such a treasure and therefore his face was beaming and he laughingly dropped the money deep into his pocket
if you are going up to the uncle as we are you can carry the pack till we get there said deta
they still had to climb a steep ascent that lay behind peters hut
the boy readily took the things and followed deta his left arm holding the bundle and his right swinging the stick
heidi jumped along gaily by his side with the goats
after three quarters of an hour they reached the height where the hut of the old man stood on a prominent rock exposed to every wind but bathed in the full sunlight
from there you could gaze far down into the valley
behind the hut stood three old firtrees with great shaggy branches
further back the old grey rocks rose high and sheer
above them you could see green and fertile pastures till at last the stony boulders reached the bare steep cliffs
overlooking the valley the uncle had made himself a bench by the side of the hut
here he sat with his pipe between his teeth and both hands resting on his knees
he quietly watched the children climbing up with the goats and aunt deta behind them for the children had caught up to her long ago
heidi reached the top first and approaching the old man she held out her hand to him and said good evening grandfather
well well what does that mean
replied the old man in a rough voice
giving her his hand for only a moment he watched her with a long and penetrating look from under his bushy brows
heidi gazed back at him with an unwinking glance and examined him with much curiosity for he was strange to look at with his thick grey beard and shaggy eyebrows that met in the middle like a thicket
heidis aunt had arrived in the meantime with peter who was eager to see what was going to happen
goodday to you uncle said deta as she approached
tobiass and adelheids child
you wont be able to remember her because last time you saw her she was scarcely a year old
why do you bring her here
asked the uncle and turning to peter he said get away and bring my goats
how late you are already
peter obeyed and disappeared on the spot the uncle had looked at him in such a manner that he was glad to go
uncle i have brought the little girl for you to keep said deta
i have done my share these last four years and now it is your turn to provide for her
the old mans eyes flamed with anger
what on earth shall i do when she begins to whine and cry for you
small children always do and then ill be helpless
youll have to look out for that
deta retorted
when the little baby was left in my hands a few years ago i had to find out how to care for the little innocent myself and nobody told me anything
i already had mother on my hands and there was plenty for me to do
you cant blame me if i want to earn some money now
if you cant keep the child you can do with her whatever you please
if she comes to harm you are responsible and i am sure you do not want to burden your conscience any further
deta had said more in her excitement than she had intended just because her conscience was not quite clear
the uncle had risen during her last words and now he gave her such a look that she retreated a few steps
stretching out his arm in a commanding gesture he said to her away with you
stay wherever you came from and dont venture soon again into my sight
deta did not have to be told twice
she said goodbye to heidi and farewell to the uncle and started down the mountain
like steam her excitement seemed to drive her forward and she ran down at a tremendous rate
the people in the village called to her now more than they had on her way up because they all were wondering where she had left the child
they were well acquainted with both and knew their history
when she heard from door and windows where is the child
where have you left her deta
and so forth she answered more and more reluctantly up with the almunclewith the almuncle
she became much provoked because the women called to her from every side how could you do it
the poor little creature
the idea of leaving such a helpless child up there
and over and over again the poor little dear
deta ran as quickly as she could and was glad when she heard no more calls because to tell the truth she herself was uneasy
her mother had asked her on her deathbed to care for
but she consoled herself with the thought that she would be able to do more for the child if she could earn some money
she was very glad to go away from people who interfered in her affairs and looked forward with great delight to her new place
illustration
with the grandfather
after deta had disappeared the uncle sat down again on the bench blowing big clouds of smoke out of his pipe
he did not speak but kept his eyes fastened on the ground
in the meantime heidi looked about her and discovering the goatshed peeped in
nothing could be seen inside
searching for some more interesting thing she saw the three old firtrees behind the hut
here the wind was roaring through the branches and the treetops were swaying to and fro
heidi stood still to listen
after the wind had ceased somewhat she walked round the hut back to her grandfather
she found him in exactly the same position and planting herself in front of the old man with arms folded behind her back she gazed at him
the grandfather looking up saw the child standing motionless before him
what do you want to do now
he asked her
i want to see whats in the hut replied heidi
come then and with that the grandfather got up and entered the cottage
take your things along he commanded
i do not want them any more answered heidi
the old man turning about threw a penetrating glance at her
the childs black eyes were sparkling in expectation of all the things to come
she is not lacking in intelligence he muttered to himself
aloud he added why dont you need them any more
i want to go about like the lightfooted goats
all right you can but fetch the things and well put them in the cupboard
the child obeyed the command
the old man now opened the door and heidi followed him into a fairly spacious room which took in the entire expanse of the hut
in one corner stood a table and a chair and in another the grandfathers bed
across the room a large kettle was suspended over the hearth and opposite to it a large door was sunk into the wall
this the grandfather opened
it was the cupboard in which all his clothes were kept
in one shelf were a few shirts socks and towels on another a few plates cups and glasses and on the top shelf heidi could see a round loaf of bread some bacon and cheese
in this cupboard the grandfather kept everything that he needed for his subsistence
when he opened it heidi pushed her things as far behind the grandfathers clothes as she could reach
she did not want them found again in a hurry
after looking around attentively in the room she asked where am i going to sleep grandfather
wherever you want to he replied
that suited heidi exactly
she peeped into all the corners of the room and looked at every little nook to find a cosy place to sleep
beside the old mans bed she saw a ladder
climbing up she arrived at a hayloft which was filled with fresh and fragrant hay
through a tiny round window she could look far down into the valley
illustration here a neat little bed was prepared i want to sleep up here heidi called down
oh it is lovely here
please come up grandfather and see it for yourself
i know it sounded from below
i am making the bed now the little girl called out again while she ran busily to and fro
oh do come up and bring a sheet grandfather for every bed must have a sheet
is that so
said the old man
after a while he opened the cupboard and rummaged around in it
at last he pulled out a long coarse cloth from under the shirts
it somewhat resembled a sheet and with this he climbed up to the loft
here a neat little bed was already prepared
on top the hay was heaped up high so that the head of the occupant would lie exactly opposite the window
the grandfather was well pleased with the arrangement
to prevent the hard floor from being felt he made the couch twice as thick
then he and heidi together put the heavy sheet on tucking the ends in well
heidi looked thoughtfully at her fresh new bed and said grandfather we have forgotten something
i have no cover
when i go to bed i always creep in between the sheet and the cover
what shall we do if i havent any
asked the grandfather
never mind ill just take some more hay to cover me heidi reassured him and was just going to the heap of hay when the old man stopped her
just wait one minute he said and went down to his own bed
from it he took a large heavy linen bag and brought it to the child
isnt this better than hay
heidi pulled the sack to and fro with all her might but she could not unfold it for it was too heavy for her little arms
the grandfather put the thick cover on the bed while heidi watched him
after it was all done she said what a nice bed i have now and what a splendid cover
i only wish the evening was here that i might go to sleep in it
i think we might eat something first said the grandfather
dont you think so
heidi had forgotten everything else in her interest for the bed but when she was reminded of her dinner she noticed how terribly hungry she really was
she had had only a piece of bread and a cup of thin coffee very early in the morning before her long journey
heidi said approvingly i think we might grandfather
lets go down then if we agree said the old man and followed close behind her
going up to the fireplace he pushed the big kettle aside and reached for a smaller one that was suspended on a chain
then sitting down on a threelegged stool he kindled a bright fire
when the kettle was boiling the old man put a large piece of cheese on a long iron fork and held it over the fire turning it to and fro till it was goldenbrown on all sides
heidi had watched him eagerly
suddenly she ran to the cupboard
when her grandfather brought a pot and the toasted cheese to the table he found it already nicely set with two plates and two knives and the bread in the middle
heidi had seen the things in the cupboard and knew that they would be needed for the meal
i am glad to see that you can think for yourself said the grandfather while he put the cheese on top of the bread but something is missing yet
heidi saw the steaming pot and ran back to the cupboard in all haste
a single little bowl was on the shelf
that did not perplex heidi though for she saw two glasses standing behind
with those three things she returned to the table
you certainly can help yourself
where shall you sit though
asked the grandfather who occupied the only chair himself heidi flew to the hearth and bringing back the little stool sat down on it
now you have a seat but it is much too low
in fact you are too little to reach the table from my chair
now you shall have something to eat at last
and with that the grandfather filled the little bowl with milk
putting it on his chair he pushed it as near to the stool as was possible and in that way heidi had a table before her
he commanded her to eat the large piece of bread and the slice of golden cheese
he sat down himself on a corner of the table and started his own dinner
heidi drank without stopping for she felt exceedingly thirsty after her long journey
taking a long breath she put down her little bowl
how do you like the milk
the grandfather asked her
i never tasted better answered heidi
then you shall have more and with that the grandfather filled the little bowl again
the little girl ate and drank with the greatest enjoyment
after she was through both went out into the goatshed
here the old man busied himself and heidi watched him attentively while he was sweeping and putting down fresh straw for the goats to sleep on
then he went to the little shop alongside and fashioned a high chair for heidi to the little girls greatest amazement
what is this
asked the grandfather
this is a chair for me
i am sure of it because it is so high
how quickly it was made
said the child full of admiration and wonder
she knows what is what and has her eyes on the right place the grandfather said to himself while he walked around the hut fastening a nail or a loose board here and there
he wandered about with his hammer and nails repairing whatever was in need of fixing
heidi followed him at every step and watched the performance with great enjoyment and attention
at last the evening came
the old firtrees were rustling and a mighty wind was roaring and howling through the treetops
those sounds thrilled heidis heart and filled it with happiness and joy
she danced and jumped about under the trees for those sounds made her feel as if a wonderful thing had happened to her
the grandfather stood under the door watching her when suddenly a shrill whistle was heard
heidi stood still and the grandfather joined her outside
down from the heights came one goat after another with peter in their midst
uttering a cry of joy heidi ran into the middle of the flock greeting her old friends
when they had all reached the hut they stopped on their way and two beautiful slender goats came out of the herd one of them white and the other brown
they came up to the grandfather who held out some salt in his hands to them as he did every night
heidi tenderly caressed first one and then the other seeming beside herself with joy
are they ours grandfather
do they both belong to us
are they going to the stable
are they going to stay with us
heidi kept on asking in her excitement
the grandfather hardly could put in a yes yes surely between her numerous questions
when the goats had licked up all the salt the old man said go in heidi and fetch your bowl and the bread
heidi obeyed and returned instantly
the grandfather milked a full bowl from the white goat cut a piece of bread for the child and told her to eat
afterwards you can go to bed
if you need some shirts and other linen you will find them in the bottom of the cupboard
deta has left a bundle for you
now goodnight i have to look after the goats and lock them up for the night
goodnight grandfather
oh please tell me what their names are called heidi after him
the white ones name is schwnli and the brown one i call brli was his answer
goodnight schwnli
goodnight brli the little girl called loudly for they were just disappearing in the shed
heidi now sat down on the bench and took her supper
the strong wind nearly blew her from her seat so she hurried with her meal to be able to go inside and up to her bed
she slept in it as well as a prince on his royal couch
very soon after heidi had gone up before it was quite dark the old man also sought his bed
he was always up in the morning with the sun which rose early over the mountainside in those summer days
it was a wild stormy night the hut was shaking in the gusts and all the boards were creaking
the wind howled through the chimney and the old firtrees shook so strongly that many a dry branch came crashing down
in the middle of the night the grandfather got up saying to himself i am sure she is afraid
climbing up the ladder he went up to
heidis bed
the first moment everything lay in darkness when all of a sudden the moon came out behind the clouds and sent his brilliant light across heidis bed
her cheeks were burning red and she lay peacefully on her round and chubby arms
she must have had a happy dream for she was smiling in her sleep
the grandfather stood and watched her till a cloud flew over the moon and left everything in total darkness
then he went down to seek his bed again
on the pasture
heidi was awakened early next morning by a loud whistle
opening her eyes she saw her little bed and the hay beside her bathed in golden sunlight
for a short while she did not know where she was but when she heard her grandfathers deep voice outside she recollected everything
she remembered how she had come up the mountain the day before and left old ursula who was always shivering with cold and sat near the stove all day
while heidi lived with ursula she had always been obliged to keep in the house where the old woman could see her
being deaf ursula was afraid to let heidi go outdoors and the child had often fretted in the narrow room and had longed to run outside
she was therefore delighted to find herself in her new home and hardly could wait to see the goats again
jumping out of bed she put on her few things and in a short time went down the ladder and ran outside
peter was already there with his flock waiting for schwnli and
brli whom the grandfather was just bringing to join the other goats
do you want to go with him to the pasture
asked the grandfather
yes cried heidi clapping her hands
go now and wash yourself first for the sun will laugh at you if he sees how dirty you are
everything is ready there for you he added pointing to a large tub of water that stood in the sun
heidi did as she was told and washed and rubbed herself till her cheeks were glowing
in the meanwhile the grandfather called to peter to come into the hut and bring his bag along
the boy followed the old man who commanded him to open the bag in which he carried his scanty dinner
the grandfather put into the bag a piece of bread and a slice of cheese that were easily twice as large as those the boy had in the bag himself
the little bowl goes in too said the uncle for the child does not know how to drink straight from the goat the way you do
she is going to stay with you all day therefore milk two bowls full for her dinner
look out that she does not fall over the rocks
do you hear
just then heidi came running in
grandfather can the sun still laugh at me
the child had rubbed herself so violently with the coarse towel which the grandfather had put beside the tub that her face neck and arms were as red as a lobster
with a smile the grandfather said no he cant laugh any more now but when you come home tonight you must go into the tub like a fish
when one goes about like the goats one gets dirty feet
they started merrily up the alp
a cloudless deepblue sky looked down on them for the wind had driven away every little cloud in the night
the fresh green mountainside was bathed in brilliant sunlight and many blue and yellow flowers had opened
heidi was wild with joy and ran from side to side
in one place she saw big patches of fine red primroses on another spot blue gentians sparkled in the grass and everywhere the golden rockroses were nodding to her
in her transport at finding such treasures heidi even forgot peter and his goats
she ran far ahead of him and then strayed away off to one side for the sparkling flowers tempted her here and there
picking whole bunches of them to take home with her she put them all into her little apron
peter whose round eyes could only move about slowly had a hard time looking out for her
the goats were even worse and only by shouting and whistling especially by swinging his rod could he drive them together
heidi where are you now
he called quite angrily
here it sounded from somewhere
peter could not see her for she was sitting on the ground behind a little mound which was covered with fragrant flowers
the whole air was filled with their perfume and the child drew it in in long breaths
follow me now
peter called out
the grandfather has told me to look out for you and you must not fall over the rocks
where are they
asked heidi without even stirring
way up there and we have still far to go
if you come quickly we may see the eagle there and hear him shriek
that tempted heidi and she came running to peter with her apron full of flowers
you have enough now he declared
if you pick them all today there wont be any left tomorrow
heidi admitted that besides which she had her apron already full
from now on she stayed at peters side
the goats scenting the pungent herbs also hurried up without delay
peter generally took his quarters for the day at the foot of a high cliff which seemed to reach far up into the sky
overhanging rocks on one side made it dangerous so that the grandfather was wise to warn
after they had reached their destination the boy took off his bag putting it in a little hollow in the ground
the wind often blew in violent gusts up there and peter did not want to lose his precious load
then he lay down in the sunny grass for he was very tired
heidi taking off her apron rolled it tightly together and put it beside peters bag
then sitting down beside the boy she looked about her
far down she saw the glistening valley a large field of snow rose high in front of her
heidi sat a long time without stirring with peter asleep by her side and the goats climbing about between the bushes
a light breeze fanned her cheek and those big mountains about her made her feel happy as never before
she looked up at the mountaintops till they all seemed to have faces and soon they were familiar to her like old friends
suddenly she heard a loud sharp scream and looking up she beheld the largest bird she had ever seen flying above her
with outspread wings he flew in large circles over heidis head
wake up peter
heidi called
look up peter and see the eagle there
peter got wide wake and then they both watched the bird breathlessly
it rose higher and higher into the azure till it disappeared at last behind the mountainpeak
where has it gone
heidi asked
home to its nest was peters answer
oh does it really live way up there
how wonderful that must be
but tell me why it screams so loud
heidi inquired
because it has to peter replied
oh lets climb up there and see its nest
implored heidi but
peter expressing decided disapproval in his voice answered oh dear oh dear not even goats could climb up there
grandfather has told me not to let you fall down the rocks so we cant go
peter now began to call loudly and to whistle and soon all the goats were assembled on the green field
heidi ran into their midst for she loved to see them leaping and playing about
peter in the meantime was preparing dinner for heidi and himself by putting her large pieces on one side and his own small ones on the other
then he milked brli and put the full bowl in the middle
when he was ready he called to the little girl
but it took some time before she obeyed his call
illustration she handed him also the whole slice of cheese stop jumping now said peter and sit down your dinner is ready
is this milk for me
she inquired
yes it is those large pieces also belong to you
when you are through with the milk ill get you some more
after that ill get mine
what milk do you get
heidi inquired
i get it from my own goat that speckled one over there
but go ahead and eat
peter commanded again
heidi obeyed and when the bowl was empty he filled it again
breaking off a piece of bread for herself she gave peter the rest which was still bigger than his own portion had been
she handed him also the whole slice of cheese saying you can eat that i have had enough
peter was speechless with surprise for it would have been impossible for him ever to give up any of his share
not taking heidi in earnest he hesitated till she put the things on his knees
then he saw she really meant it and he seized his prize
nodding his thanks to her he ate the most luxurious meal he had ever had in all his life
heidi was watching the goats in the meantime and asked peter for their names
the boy could tell them all to her for their names were about the only thing he had to carry in his head
she soon knew them too for she had listened attentively
one of them was the big turk who tried to stick his big horns into all the others
most of the goats ran away from their rough comrade
a small white goat called snowhopper kept up bleating in the most piteous way which induced heidi to console it several times
heidi at last went to the little thing again and throwing her arms around its head she asked what is the matter with you snowhopper
why do you always cry for help
the little goat pressed close to heidis side and became perfectly quiet
peter was still eating but between the swallows he called to heidi she is so unhappy because the old goat has left us
she was sold to somebody in
mayenfeld two days ago
who was the old goat
her mother of course
where is her grandmother
she hasnt any
and her grandfather
hasnt any either
poor little snowhopper
said heidi drawing the little creature tenderly to her
dont grieve any more see i am coming up with you every day now and if there is anything the matter you can come to me
snowhopper rubbed her head against heidis shoulder and stopped bleating
when peter had finally finished his dinner he joined heidi
the little girl had just been observing that schwnli and brli were by far the cleanest and prettiest of the goats
they evaded the obtrusive turk with a sort of contempt and always managed to find the greenest bushes for themselves
she mentioned it to peter who replied i know
of course they are the prettiest because the uncle washes them and gives them salt
he has the best stable by far
all of a sudden peter who had been lying on the ground jumped up and bounded after the goats
heidi knowing that something must have happened followed him
she saw him running to a dangerous abyss on the side
peter had noticed how the rash thistlefinch had gone nearer and nearer to the dangerous spot
peter only just came in time to prevent the goat from falling down over the very edge
unfortunately
peter had stumbled over a stone in his hurry and was only able to catch the goat by one leg
the thistlefinch being enraged to find himself stopped in his charming ramble bleated furiously
not being able to get up peter loudly called for help
heidi immediately saw that peter was nearly pulling off the animals leg
she quickly picked some fragrant herbs and holding them under the animals nose she said soothingly come come thistlefinch and be sensible
you might fall down there and break your leg
that would hurt you horribly
the goat turned about and devoured the herbs heidi held in her hand
when peter got to his feet he led back the runaway with heidis help
when he had the goat in safety he raised his rod to beat it for punishment
the goat retreated shyly for it knew what was coming
heidi screamed loudly peter no do not beat him
look how scared he is
he well deserves it snarled peter ready to strike
but heidi seizing his arm shouted full of indignation you mustnt hurt him
let him go
heidis eyes were sparkling and when he saw her with her commanding mien he desisted and dropped his rope
ill let him go if you give me a piece of your cheese again tomorrow he said for he wanted a compensation for his fright
you may have it all tomorrow and every day because i dont need it heidi assured him
i shall also give you a big piece of bread if you promise never to beat any of the goats
i dont care growled peter and in that way he gave his promise
thus the day had passed and the sun was already sinking down behind the mountains
sitting on the grass heidi looked at the bluebells and the wild roses that were shining in the last rays of the sun
the peaks also started to glow and heidi suddenly called to the boy oh
peter look
everything is on fire
the mountains are burning and the sky too
the moon over there is on fire too
do you see the mountains all in a glow
oh how beautiful the snow looks
peter the eagles nest is surely on fire too
oh look at the firtrees over there
peter was quietly peeling his rod and looking up said to heidi this is no fire it always looks like that
but what is it then
asked heidi eagerly gazing about her everywhere
it gets that way of itself explained peter
everything is all rosy now
oh look at this mountain over there with the snow and the sharp peaks
what is its name
mountains have no names he answered
oh see how beautiful
it looks as if many many roses were growing on those cliffs
oh now they are getting grey
the fire has gone out and it is all over
what a terrible shame
said heidi quite despondently
it will be the same again tomorrow peter reassured her
come now we have to go home
when peter had called the goats together they started downwards
will it be like that every day when we are up
asked heidi eagerly
it usually is was the reply
what about tomorrow
she inquired
tomorrow it will be like that i am sure peter affirmed
that made heidi feel happy again
she walked quietly by peters side thinking over all the new things she had seen
at last reaching the hut they found the grandfather waiting for them on a bench under the firtrees
heidi ran up to him and the two goats followed for they knew their master
peter called to her come again tomorrow
heidi gave him her hand assuring him that she would come and finding herself surrounded by the goats she hugged snowhopper a last time
when peter had disappeared heidi returned to her grandfather
oh grandfather
it was so beautiful
i saw the fire and the roses on the rocks
and see the many many flowers i am bringing you
heidi shook them out of her apron
but oh how miserable they looked
heidi did not even know them any more
what is the matter with them grandfather
they looked so different
heidi exclaimed in her fright
they are made to bloom in the sun and not to be shut up in an apron said the grandfather
then i shall never pick them any more
please grandfather tell me why the eagle screeches so loudly asked heidi
first go and take a bath while i go into the shed to get your milk
afterwards well go inside together and ill tell you all about it during suppertime
they did as was proposed and when heidi sat on her high chair before her milk she asked the same question as before
because he is sneering at the people down below who sit in the villages and make each other angry
he calls down to themif you would go apart to live up on the heights like me you would feel much better
the grandfather said these last words with such a wild voice that it reminded heidi of the eagles screech
why do the mountains have no names grandfather
asked heidi
they all have names and if you tell me their shape i can name them for you
heidi described several and the old man could name them all
the child told him now about all the happenings of the day and especially about the wonderful fire
she asked how it came about
the sun does it he exclaimed
saying goodnight to the mountains he throws his most beautiful rays to them that they may not forget him till the morning
heidi was so much pleased with this explanation that she could hardly wait to see the suns goodnight greetings repeated
it was time now to go to bed and heidi slept soundly all night
she dreamt that the little snowhopper was bounding happily about on the glowing mountains with many glistening roses blooming round her
in the grandmothers hut
next morning peter came again with his goats and heidi went up to the pasture with them
this happened day after day and in this healthy life heidi grew stronger and more sunburnt every day
it always made peter unhappy when heidi did not come along for he saw nothing but misfortunes ahead of him he hardly knew how to pass his time and besides he was deprived of his abundant dinner
the goats were so accustomed to heidi by this time that they did not follow
peter when she was not with him
heidi herself did not mind staying at home for she loved nothing better than to watch her grandfather with his saw and hammer
sometimes the grandfather would make small round cheeses on those days and there was no greater pleasure for heidi than to see him stir the butter with his bare arms
when the wind would howl through the firtrees on those stormy days heidi would run out to the grove thrilled and happy by the wondrous roaring in the branches
the sun had lost its vigor and the child had to put on her shoes and stockings and her little dress
the weather got colder and colder and when peter came up in the morning he would blow into his hands he was so frozen
at last even
peter could not come any more for a deep snow had fallen over night
heidi stood at the window watching the snow falling down
it kept on snowing till it reached the windows still it did not stop and soon the windows could not be opened and they were all shut in
when it had lasted for several days heidi thought that it would soon cover up the cottage
it finally stopped and the grandfather went out to shovel the snow away from the door and windows piling it up high here and there
in the afternoon the two were sitting near the fire when noisy steps were heard outside and the door was pushed open
peter who had come up to see heidi
muttering goodevening he went up to the fire
his face was beaming and heidi had to laugh when she saw little waterfalls trickling down from his person for all the ice and snow had melted in the great heat
the grandfather now asked peter how he got along in school
heidi was so interested that she asked him a hundred questions
poor peter who was not an easy talker found himself in great difficulty answering the little girls inquiries but at least it gave him leisure to dry his clothes
during this conversation the grandfathers eyes had been twinkling and at last he said to the boy now that you have been under fire general you need some strengthening
come and join us at supper
with that the old man prepared a meal which amply satisfied peters appetite
it had begun to get dark and peter knew that it was time to go
he had said goodbye and thank you when turning to heidi he remarked ill come next sunday if i may
by the way heidi grandmother asked me to tell you that she would love to see you
heidi immediately approved of this idea and her first word next morning was grandfather i must go down to grandmother
she is expecting me
four days later the sun was shining and the tightpacked frozen snow was crackling under every step
heidi was sitting at the dinnertable imploring the old man to let her make the visit then when he got up and fetching down her heavy cover told her to follow him
they went out into the glistening snow no sound was heard and the snowladen firtrees shone and glittered in the sun
heidi in her transport was running to and fro grandfather come out
oh look at the trees
they are all covered with silver and gold she called to the grandfather who had just come out of his workshop with a wide sled
wrapping the child up in her cover he put her on the sled holding her fast
off they started at such a pace that heidi shouted for joy for she seemed to be flying like a bird
the sled had stopped in front of peters hut and grandfather said go in
when it gets dark start on your way home
when he had unwrapped her he turned homewards with his sled
illustration off they started at such a pace that heidi shouted for
opening the door heidi found herself in a tiny dark kitchen and going through another door she entered a narrow chamber
near a table a woman was seated busy with mending peters coat which heidi had recognized immediately
a bent old woman was sitting in a corner and
heidi approaching her at once said how do you do grandmother
i have come now and i hope i havent kept you waiting too long
lifting her head the grandmother sought for heidis hand
feeling it thoughtfully she said are you the little girl who lives up with the uncle
is your name heidi
yes heidi replied
the grandfather just brought me down in the sled
how is it possible
your hands are as warm as toast
brigida did the uncle really come down with the child
brigida peters mother had gotten up to look at the child
she said i dont know if he did but i dont think so
she probably doesnt know
heidi looking up said quite decidedly i know that grandfather wrapped me up in a cover when we coasted down together
peter was right after all said the grandmother
we never thought the child would live more than three weeks with him
brigida tell me what she looks like
she has adelheids fine limbs and black eyes and curly hair like
tobias and the old man
i think she looks like both of them
while the women were talking heidi had been taking in everything
then she said grandmother look at the shutter over there
it is hanging loose
if grandfather were here he would fasten it
it will break the windowpane
just look at it
what a sweet child you are said the grandmother tenderly
i can hear it but i cannot see it child
this cottage rattles and creaks and when the wind blows it comes in through every chink
some day the whole house will break to pieces and fall on top of us
if only peter knew how to mend it
we have no one else
why grandmother cant you see the shutter
asked heidi
child i cannot see anything lamented the old woman
can you see it when i open the shutter to let in the light
no no not even then
nobody can ever show me the light again
but you can see when you go out into the snow where everything is bright
come with me grandmother ill show you
and heidi taking the old woman by the hand tried to lead her out
heidi was frightened and got more anxious all the time
just let me stay here child
everything is dark for me and my poor eyes can neither see the snow nor the light
but grandmother does it not get light in the summer when the sun shines down on the mountains to say goodnight setting them all aflame
no child i can never see the fiery mountains any more
i have to live in darkness always
heidi burst out crying now and sobbed aloud
can nobody make it light for you
is there nobody who can do it grandmother
the grandmother tried all possible means to comfort the child it wrung her heart to see her terrible distress
it was awfully hard for
heidi to stop crying when she had once begun for she cried so seldom
the grandmother said heidi let me tell you something
people who cannot see love to listen to friendly words
sit down beside me and tell me all about yourself
talk to me about your grandfather for it has been long since i have heard anything about him
i used to know him very well
heidi suddenly wiped away her tears for she had had a cheering thought
grandmother i shall tell grandfather about it and i am sure he can make it light for you
he can mend your little house and stop the rattling
the old woman remained silent and heidi with the greatest vivacity began to describe her life with the grandfather
listening attentively the two women would say to each other sometimes do you hear what she says about the uncle
did you listen
heidis tale was interrupted suddenly by a great thumping on the door and who should come in but peter
no sooner had he seen heidi than he smiled opening his round eyes as wide as possible
heidi called goodevening peter
is it really time for him to come home
exclaimed peters grandmother
how quickly the time has flown
goodevening little
peter how is your reading going
just the same the boy replied
oh dear i was hoping for a change at last
you are nearly twelve years old my boy
why should there be a change
inquired heidi with greatest interest
i am afraid hell never learn it after all
on the shelf over there is an old prayerbook with beautiful songs
i have forgotten them all for i do not hear them any more
i longed that peter should read them to me some day but he will never be able to
peters mother got up from her work now saying i must make a light
the afternoon has passed and now its getting dark
when heidi heard those words she started and holding out her hand to all she said goodnight
i have to go for it is getting dark
but the anxious grandmother called out wait child dont go up alone
go with her peter and take care that she does not fall
dont let her get cold do you hear
has heidi a shawl
i havent but i wont be cold heidi called back for she had already escaped through the door
she ran so fast that peter could hardly follow her
the old woman frettingly called out brigida run after her
get a warm shawl shell freeze in this cold night
brigida obeyed
the children had hardly climbed any distance when they saw the old man coming and with a few vigorous steps he stood beside them
i am glad you kept your word heidi he said and packing her into her cover he started up the hill carrying the child in his arms
brigida had come in time to see it and told the grandmother what she had witnessed
thank god thank god
the old woman said
i hope shell come again she has done me so much good
what a soft heart she has the darling and how nicely she can talk
all evening the grandmother said to herself if only he lets her come again
i have something to look forward to in this world now thank god
heidi could hardly wait before they reached the cottage
she had tried to talk on the way but no sound could be heard through the heavy cover
as soon as they were inside the hut she began grandfather we must take some nails and a hammer down tomorrow a shutter is loose in grandmothers house and many other places shake
everything rattles in her house
is that so
who says we must
nobody told me but i know heidi replied
everything is loose in the house and poor grandmother told me she was afraid that the house might tumble down
and grandfather she cannot see the light
can you help her and make it light for her
how terrible it must be to be afraid in the dark and nobody there to help you
oh please grandfather do something to help her
i know you can
heidi had been clinging to her grandfather and looking up to him with trusting eyes
at last he said glancing down all right child well see that it wont rattle any more
we can do it tomorrow
heidi was so overjoyed at these words that she danced around the room shouting well do it tomorrow
we can do it tomorrow
the grandfather keeping his word took heidi down the following day with the same instructions as before
after heidi had disappeared he went around the house inspecting it
the grandmother in her joy at seeing the child again had stopped the wheel and called here is the child again
she has come again
heidi grasping her outstretched hands sat herself on a low stool at the old womans feet and began to chat
suddenly violent blows were heard outside the grandmother in her fright nearly upset the spinningwheel and screamed oh god it has come at last
the hut is tumbling down
grandmother dont be frightened said the child while she put her arms around her
grandfather is just fastening the shutter and fixing everything for you
is it possible
has god not forgotten us after all
brigida have you heard it
surely that is a hammer
ask him to come in a moment if it is he for i must thank him
when brigida went out she found the old man busy with putting a new beam along the wall
approaching him she said mother and i wish you a goodafternoon
we are very much obliged to you for doing us such a service and mother would like to see you
there are few that would have done it uncle and how can we thank you
that will do he interrupted
i know what your opinion about me is
go in for i can find what needs mending myself
brigida obeyed for the uncle had a way that nobody could oppose
all afternoon the uncle hammered around he even climbed up on the roof where much was missing
at last he had to stop for the last nail was gone from his pocket
the darkness had come in the meantime and
heidi was ready to go up with him packed warmly in his arms
thus the winter passed
sunshine had come again into the blind womans life and made her days less dark and dreary
early every morning she would begin to listen for heidis footsteps and when the door was opened and the child ran in the grandmother exclaimed every time more joyfully thank god she has come again
heidi would talk about her life and make the grandmother smile and laugh and in that way the hours flew by
in former times the old woman had always sighed brigida is the day not over yet
but now she always exclaimed after heidis departure how quickly the afternoon has gone by
dont you think so too brigida
her daughter had to assent for heidi had long ago won her heart
if only god will spare us the child
the grandmother would often say
i hope the uncle will always be kind as he is now
does heidi look well
was a frequent question which always got a reassuring answer
heidi also became very fond of the old grandmother and when the weather was fair she visited her every day that winter
whenever the child remembered that the grandmother was blind she would get very sad her only comfort was that her coming brought such happiness
the grandfather soon had mended the cottage often he would take down big loads of timber which he used to good purpose
the grandmother vowed that no rattling could be heard any more and that thanks to the uncles kindness she slept better that winter than she had done for many a year
illustration
two visitors
two winters had nearly passed
heidi was happy for the spring was coming again with the soft delicious wind that made the firtrees roar
soon she would be able to go up to the pasture where blue and yellow flowers greeted her at every step
she was nearly eight years old and had learned to take care of the goats who ran after her like little dogs
several times the village teacher had sent word by peter that the child was wanted in school but the old man had not paid any attention to the message and had kept her with him as before
it was a beautiful morning in march
the snow had melted on the slopes and was going fast
snowdrops were peeping through the ground which seemed to be getting ready for spring
heidi was running to and fro before the door when she suddenly saw an old gentleman dressed in black standing beside her
as she appeared frightened he said kindly you must not be afraid of me for i love children
give me your hand
heidi and tell me where your grandfather is
he is inside making round wooden spoons the child replied opening the door while she spoke
it was the old pastor of the village who had known the grandfather years ago
after entering he approached the old man saying goodmorning neighbor
the old man got up surprised and offering a seat to the visitor said goodmorning mr
here is a wooden chair if it is good enough
sitting down the parson said it is long since i have seen you neighbor
i have come today to talk over a matter with you
i am sure you can guess what it is about
the clergyman here looked at heidi who was standing near the door
heidi run out to see the goats said the grandfather and bring them some salt you can stay till i come
heidi disappeared on the spot
the child should have come to school a year ago the parson went on to say
didnt you get the teachers warning
what do you intend to do with the child
i do not want her to go to school said the old man unrelentingly
what do you want the child to be
i want her to be free and happy as a bird
but she is human and it is high time for her to learn something
i have come now to tell you about it so that you can make your plans
she must come to school next winter remember that
i shant do it pastor
was the reply
do you think there is no way
the clergyman replied a little hotly
you know the world for you have travelled far
what little sense you show
you think i am going to send this delicate child to school in every storm and weather
the old man said excitedly
it is a two hours walk and i shall not let her go for the wind often howls so that it chokes me if i venture out
did you know adelheid her mother
she was a sleepwalker and had faintingfits
nobody shall compel me to let her go i will gladly fight it out in court
you are perfectly right said the clergyman kindly
you could not send her to school from here
why dont you come down to live among us again
you are leading a strange life here i wonder how you can keep the child warm in winter
she has young blood and a good cover
i know where to find good wood and all winter i keep a fire going
i couldnt live in the village for the people there and i despise each other we had better keep apart
you are mistaken i assure you
make your peace with god and then youll see how happy you will be
the clergyman had risen and holding out his hand he said cordially i shall count on you next winter neighbor
we shall receive you gladly reconciled with god and man
but the uncle replied firmly while he shook his visitor by the hand thank you for your kindness but you will have to wait in vain
god be with you said the parson and left him sadly
the old man was out of humor that day and when heidi begged to go to the grandmother he only growled not today
next day they had hardly finished their dinner when another visitor arrived
heidis aunt deta she wore a hat with feathers and a dress with such a train that it swept up everything that lay on the cottage floor
while the uncle looked at her silently deta began to praise him and the childs red cheeks
she told him that it had not been her intention to leave heidi with him long for she knew she must be in his way
she had tried to provide for the child elsewhere and at last she had found a splendid chance for her
very rich relations of her lady who owned the largest house in frankfurt had a lame daughter
this poor little girl was confined to her rollingchair and needed a companion at her lessons
deta had heard from her lady that a sweet quaint child was wanted as playmate and schoolmate for the invalid
she had gone to the housekeeper and told her all about heidi
the lady delighted with the idea had told her to fetch the child at once
she had come now and it was a lucky chance for heidi for one never knew what might happen in such a case and who could tell have you finished
the old man interrupted her at last
why one might think i was telling you the silliest things
there is not a man in prtiggan who would not thank god for such news
bring them to somebody else but not to me said the uncle coldly
deta flaming up replied do you want to hear what i think
dont i know how old she is eight years old and ignorant of everything
they have told me that you refuse to send her to church and to school
she is my only sisters child and i shall not bear it for i am responsible
you do not care for her how else could you be indifferent to such luck
you had better give way or i shall get the people to back me
if i were you i would not have it brought to court some things might be warmed up that you would not care to hear about
the uncle thundered with flaming eyes
take her and ruin her but do not bring her before my sight again
i do not want to see her with feathers in her hat and wicked words like yours
with long strides he went out
you have made him angry
said heidi with a furious look
he wont be cross long
but come now where are your things
i wont come heidi replied
deta said passionately
but changing her tone she continued in a more friendly manner come now you dont understand me
i am taking you to the most beautiful place you have ever seen
after packing up heidis clothes she said again come child and take your hat
it is not very nice but we cant help it
i shall not come was the reply
dont be stupid and obstinate like a goat
listen to me
grandfather is sending us away and we must do what he commands or he will get more angry still
youll see how fine it is in frankfurt
if you do not like it you can come home again and by that time grandfather will have forgiven us
can i come home again tonight
asked heidi
come now i told you you could come back
if we get to mayenfeld today we can take the train tomorrow
that will make you fly home again in the shortest time
holding the bundle deta led the child down the mountain
on their way they met peter who had not gone to school that day
the boy thought it was a more useful occupation to look for hazelrods than to learn to read for he always needed the rods
he had had a most successful day for he carried an enormous bundle on his shoulder
when he caught sight of heidi and deta he asked them where they were going
i am going to frankfurt with aunt deta heidi replied but first i must see grandmother for she is waiting
oh no it is too late
you can see her when you come back but not now said deta pulling heidi along with her for she was afraid that the old woman might detain the child
peter ran into the cottage and hit the table with his rods
the grandmother jumped up in her fright and asked him what that meant
they have taken heidi away peter said with a groan
who has peter
where has she gone
the unhappy grandmother asked
brigida had seen deta walking up the footpath a short while ago and soon they guessed what had happened
with a trembling hand the old woman opened a window and called out as loudly as she could deta
deta dont take the child away
dont take her from us
when heidi heard that she struggled to get free and said i must go to grandmother she is calling me
but deta would not let her go
she urged her on by saying that she might return soon again
she also suggested that heidi might bring a lovely present to the grandmother when she came back
heidi liked this prospect and followed deta without more ado
after a while she asked what shall i bring to the grandmother
you might bring her some soft white rolls heidi
i think the black bread is too hard for poor grandmother to eat
yes i know aunt she always gives it to peter heidi confirmed her
we must go quickly now we might get to frankfurt today and then i can be back tomorrow with the rolls
illustration when heidi heard that she struggled to get free
heidi was running now and deta had to follow
she was glad enough to escape the questions that people might ask her in the village
people could see that heidi was pulling her along so she said i cant stop
dont you see how the child is hurrying
we have still far to go whenever she heard from all sides are you taking her with you
is she running away from the uncle
what a wonder she is still alive
what red cheeks she has and so on
soon they had escaped and had left the village far behind them
from that time on the uncle looked more angry than ever when he came to the village
everybody was afraid of him and the women would warn their children to keep out of his sight
he came down but seldom and then only to sell his cheese and buy his provisions
often people remarked how lucky it was that heidi had left him
they had seen her hurrying away so they thought that she had been glad to go
the old grandmother alone stuck to him faithfully
whenever anybody came up to her she would tell them what good care the old man had taken of heidi
she also told them that he had mended her little house
these reports reached the village of course but people only half believed them for the grandmother was infirm and old
she began her days with sighing again
all happiness has left us with the child
the days are so long and dreary and i have no joy left
if only i could hear heidis voice before i die the poor old woman would exclaim day after day
illustration
a new chapter with new things
in a beautiful house in frankfurt lived a sick child by the name of
clara sesemann
she was sitting in a comfortable rollingchair which could be pushed from room to room
clara spent most of her time in the study where long rows of bookcases lined the walls
this room was used as a livingroom and here she was also given her lessons
clara had a pale thin face with soft blue eyes which at that moment were watching the clock impatiently
at last she said oh miss
rottenmeier isnt it time yet
the lady so addressed was the housekeeper who had lived with clara since mrs
sesemanns death
miss rottenmeier wore a peculiar uniform with a long cape and a high cap on her head
claras father who was away from home a great deal left the entire management of the house to this lady on the condition that his daughters wishes should always be considered
while clara was waiting deta had arrived at the front door with
she was asking the coachman who had brought her if she could go upstairs
thats not my business grumbled the coachman you must ring for the butler
sebastian the butler a man with large brass buttons on his coat soon stood before her
may i see miss rottenmeier
deta asked
thats not my business the butler announced
ring for tinette the maid
with that he disappeared
deta ringing again saw a girl with a brilliant white cap on her head coming down the stairway
the maid stopped halfway down and asked scornfully what do you want
deta repeated her wish again
tinette told her to wait while she went upstairs but it did not take long before the two were asked to come up
following the maid they found themselves in the study
deta held on to heidis hand and stayed near the door
miss rottenmeier slowly getting up approached the newcomers
she did not seem pleased with heidi who wore her hat and shawl and was looking up at the ladys headdress with innocent wonder
what is your name
the lady asked
heidi was the childs clear answer
is that a christian name
what name did you receive in baptism
inquired the lady again
i dont remember that any more the child replied
what an answer
what does that mean
said the housekeeper shaking her head
is the child ignorant or pert miss deta
i shall speak for the child if i may madam deta said after giving heidi a little blow for her unbecoming answer
the child has never been in such a fine house and does not know how to behave
i hope the lady will forgive her manners
she is called adelheid after her mother who was my sister
oh well that is better
but miss deta the child seems peculiar for her age
i thought i told you that miss claras companion would have to be twelve years old like her to be able to share her studies
how old is adelheid
i am sorry but i am afraid she is somewhat younger than i thought
i think she is about ten years old
grandfather said that i was eight years old said heidi now
deta gave her another blow but as the child had no idea why she did not get embarrassed
what only eight years old
miss rottenmeier exclaimed indignantly
how can we get along
what have you learned
what books have you studied
none said heidi
but how did you learn to read
i cant read and peter cant do it either heidi retorted
for mercys sake
you cannot read
cried the lady in her surprise
how is it possible
what else have you studied
nothing replied heidi truthfully
miss deta how could you bring this child
said the housekeeper when she was more composed
deta however was not easily intimidated and said i am sorry but
i thought this child would suit you
she is small but older children are often spoilt and not like her
i must go now for my mistress is waiting
as soon as i can ill come to see how the child is getting along
with a bow she was outside and with a few quick steps hurried downstairs
miss rottenmeier followed her and tried to call her back for she wanted to ask deta a number of questions
heidi was still standing on the same spot
clara had watched the scene and called to the child now to come to her
heidi approached the rollingchair
do you want to be called heidi or adelheid
asked clara
my name is heidi and nothing else was the childs answer
ill call you heidi then for i like it very much said clara
i have never heard the name before
what curly hair you have
was it always like that
i think so
did you like to come to frankfurt
asked clara again
oh no but then i am going home again tomorrow and shall bring grandmother some soft white rolls heidi explained
what a curious child you are said clara
you have come to
frankfurt to stay with me dont you know that
we shall have our lessons together and i think it will be great fun when you learn to read
generally the morning seems to have no end for mr
candidate comes at ten and stays till two
that is a long time and he has to yawn himself he gets so tired
miss rottenmeier and he both yawn together behind their books but when i do it miss rottenmeier makes me take codliver oil and says that i am ill
so i must swallow my yawns for i hate the oil
what fun it will be now when you learn to read
heidi shook her head doubtfully at these prospects
everybody must learn to read heidi
candidate is very patient and will explain it all to you
you wont know what he means at first for it is difficult to understand him
it wont take long to learn though and then you will know what he means
when miss rottenmeier found that she was unable to recall deta she came back to the children
she was in a very excited mood for she felt responsible for heidis coming and did not know how to cancel this unfortunate step
she soon got up again to go to the diningroom criticising the butler and giving orders to the maid
sebastian not daring to show his rage otherwise noisily opened the folding doors
when he went up to claras chair he saw heidi watching him intently
at last she said you look like peter
miss rottenmeier was horrified with this remark and sent them all into the diningroom
after clara was lifted on to her chair the housekeeper sat down beside her
heidi was motioned to sit opposite the lady
in that way they were placed at the enormous table
heidi saw a roll on her plate she turned to sebastian and pointing at it asked can i have this
heidi had already great confidence in the butler especially on account of the resemblance she had discovered
the butler nodded and when he saw heidi put the bread in her pocket could hardly keep from laughing
he came to heidi now with a dish of small baked fishes
for a long time the child did not move then turning her eyes to the butler she said must i eat that
sebastian nodded but another pause ensued
why dont you give it to me
the child quietly asked looking at her plate
the butler hardly able to keep his countenance was told to place the dish on the table and leave the room
when he was gone miss rottenmeier explained to heidi with many signs how to help herself at table
she also told her never to speak to
sebastian unless it was important
after that the child was told how to accost the servants and the governess
when the question came up of how to call clara the older girl said of course you shall call me
a great many rules followed now about behavior at all times about the shutting of doors and about going to bed and a hundred other things
poor heidis eyes were closing for she had risen at five that morning and leaning against her chair she fell asleep
rottenmeier had finished instructions she said i hope you will remember everything adelheid
did you understand me
heidi went to sleep a long time ago said clara highly amused
it is atrocious what i have to bear with this child exclaimed miss
rottenmeier ringing the bell with all her might
when the two servants arrived they were hardly able to rouse heidi enough to show her to her bedroom
miss rottenmeier has an uncomfortable day
when heidi opened her eyes next morning she did not know where she was
she found herself on a high white bed in a spacious room
looking around she observed long white curtains before the windows several chairs and a sofa covered with cretonne in a corner she saw a washstand with many curious things standing on it
suddenly heidi remembered all the happenings of the previous day
jumping out of bed she dressed in a great hurry
she was eager to look at the sky and the ground below as she had always done at home
what was her disappointment when she found that the windows were too high for her to see anything except the walls and windows opposite
trying to open them she turned from one to the other but in vain
the poor child felt like a little bird that is placed in a glittering cage for the first time
at last she had to resign herself and sat down on a low stool thinking of the melting snow on the slopes and the first flowers of spring that she had hailed with such delight
suddenly tinette opened the door and said curtly breakfasts ready
heidi did not take this for a summons for the maids face was scornful and forbidding
she was waiting patiently for what would happen next when miss rottenmeier burst into the room saying what is the matter adelheid
didnt you understand
come to breakfast
heidi immediately followed the lady into the diningroom where clara greeted her with a smile
she looked much happier than usual for she expected new things to happen that day
when breakfast had passed without disturbance the two children were allowed to go into the library together and were soon left alone
how can i see down to the ground
heidi asked
open a window and peep out replied clara amused at the question
but it is impossible to open them heidi said sadly
you cant do it and i cant help you either but if you ask
sebastian hell do it for you
heidi was relieved
the poor child had felt like a prisoner in her room
clara now asked heidi what her home had been like and heidi told her gladly about her life in the hut
the tutor had arrived in the meantime but he was not asked to go to the study as usual
miss rottenmeier was very much excited about
heidis coming and all the complications that arose therefrom
she was really responsible for it having arranged everything herself
she presented the unfortunate case before the teacher for she wanted him to help her to get rid of the child
candidate however was always careful of his judgments and not afraid of teaching beginners
when the lady saw that he would not side with her she let him enter the study alone for the abc held great horrors for her
while she considered many problems a frightful noise as of something falling was heard in the adjoining room followed by a cry to sebastian for help
running in she beheld a pile of books and papers on the floor with the tablecover on top
a black stream of ink flowed across the length of the room
heidi had disappeared
there miss rottenmeier exclaimed wringing her hands
everything drenched with ink
did such a thing ever happen before
this child brings nothing but misfortunes on us
the teacher was standing up looking at the devastation but clara was highly entertained by these events and said heidi has not done it on purpose and must not be punished
in her hurry to get away she caught on the tablecover and pulled it down
i think she must never have seen a coach in all her life for when she heard a carriage rumbling by she rushed out like mad
didnt i tell you mr
candidate that she has no idea whatever about behavior
she does not even know that she has to sit quiet at her lessons
but where has she gone
what would mr
sesemann say if she should run away
when miss rottenmeier went downstairs to look for the child she saw her standing at the open door looking down the street
what are you doing here
how can you run away like that
miss rottenmeier
i heard the firtrees rustle but i cant see them and do not hear them any more replied heidi looking in great perplexity down the street
the noise of the passing carriage had reminded her of the roaring of the southwind on the alp
what nonsense
we are not in a wood
come with me now to see what you have done
when heidi saw the devastation that she had caused she was greatly surprised for she had not noticed it in her hurry
this must never happen again said the lady sternly
you must sit quiet at your lessons if you get up again i shall tie you to your chair
do you hear me
heidi understood and gave a promise to sit quietly during her lessons from that time on
after the servants had straightened the room it was late and there was no more time for studies
nobody had time to yawn that morning
in the afternoon while clara was resting heidi was left to herself
she planted herself in the hall and waited for the butler to come upstairs with the silver things
when he reached the head of the stairs she said to him i want to ask you something
she saw that the butler seemed angry so she reassured him by saying that she did not mean any harm
all right miss what is it
my name is not miss why dont you call me heidi
miss rottenmeier told me to call you miss
well then it must be so
i have three names already sighed the child
what can i do for you
asked sebastian now
can you open a window for me
certainly he replied
sebastian got a stool for heidi for the windowsill was too high for her to see over
in great disappointment heidi turned her head away
i dont see anything but a street of stone
is it the same way on the other side of the house
where do you go to look far down on everything
on a churchtower
do you see that one over there with the golden dome
from there you can overlook everything
heidi immediately stepped down from the stool and ran downstairs
opening the door she found herself in the street but she could not see the tower any more
she wandered on from street to street not daring to accost any of the busy people
passing a corner she saw a boy who had a barrelorgan on his back and a curious animal on his arm
heidi ran to him and asked where is the tower with the golden dome
dont know was the reply
who can tell me
can you show me another church with a tower
of course i can
then come and show me
what are you going to give me for it
said the boy holding out his hand
heidi had nothing in her pocket but a little flowerpicture
clara had only given it to her this morning so she was loath to part with it
the temptation to look far down into the valley was too great for her though and she offered him the gift
the boy shook his head to heidis satisfaction
what else do you want
i have none but clara has some
how much must i give you
twenty pennies
all right but come
while they were wandering down the street heidi found out what a barrelorgan was for she had never seen one
when they arrived before an old church with a tower heidi was puzzled what to do next but having discovered a bell she pulled it with all her might
the boy agreed to wait for heidi and show her the way home if she gave him a double fee
the lock creaked now from inside and an old man opened the door
in an angry voice he said how do you dare to ring for me
cant you see that it is only for those who want to see the tower
but i do said heidi
what do you want to see
did anybody send you
asked the man
no but i want to look down from up there
get home and dont try it again
with that the towerkeeper was going to shut the door but heidi held his coattails and pleaded with him to let her come
the towerkeeper looked at the childs eyes which were nearly full of tears
all right come along if you care so much he said taking her by the hand
the two climbed up now many many steps which got narrower all the time
when they had arrived on top the old man lifted heidi up to the open window
heidi saw nothing but a sea of chimneys roofs and towers and her heart sank
oh dear its different from the way i thought it would be she said
what could such a little girl know about a view
well go down now and you must promise never to ring at my tower any more
on their way they passed an attic where a large grey cat guarded her new family in a basket
this cat caught halfadozen mice every day for herself for the old tower was full of rats and mice
heidi gazed at her in surprise and was delighted when the old man opened the basket
what charming kittens what cunning little creatures
she exclaimed in her delight when she saw them crawling about jumping and tumbling
would you like to have one
the old man asked
heidi asked for she could not believe her ears
yes of course
you can have several if you have room for them the old man said glad to find a good home for the kittens
how happy heidi was
of course there was enough room in the huge house and clara would be delighted when she saw the cunning things
how can i take them with me
the child asked after she had tried in vain to catch one
i can bring them to your house if you tell me where you live said
heidis new friend while he caressed the old cat who had lived with him many years
bring them to mr
sesemanns house there is a golden dog on the door with a ring in his mouth
the old man had lived in the tower a long time and knew everybody
sebastian also was a special friend of his
i know he said
but to whom shall i send them
do you belong to
please send them to clara she will like them i am sure
heidi could hardly tear herself away from the pretty things so the old man put one kitten in each of her pockets to console her
after that she went away
the boy was waiting patiently for her and when she had taken leave of the towerkeeper she asked the boy do you know where mr
sesemanns house is
no was the reply
she described it as well as she could till the boy remembered it
off they started and soon heidi found herself pulling the doorbell
sebastian arrived he said hurry up
heidi went in and the boy was left outside for sebastian had not even seen him
come up quickly little miss he urged
they are all waiting for you in the diningroom
miss rottenmeier looks like a loaded cannon
how could you run away like that
heidi sat down quietly on her chair
nobody said a word and there was an uncomfortable silence
at last miss rottenmeier began with a severe and solemn voice i shall speak with you later adelheid
how can you leave the house without a word
your behavior was very remiss
the idea of walking about till so late
was the reply
i didnt heidi beganmeow
sebastian nearly flung the dish on the table and disappeared
this is enough miss rottenmeier tried to say but her voice was hoarse with fury
get up and leave the room
illustration off they started and soon heidi was pulling the
heidi got up
she began again
i made meow
heidi said clara now why do you always say meow again if you see that miss rottenmeier is angry
i am not doing it its the kittens she explained
screamed the housekeeper
sebastian tinette take the horrible things away
with that she ran into the study locking herself in for she feared kittens beyond anything on earth
when sebastian had finished his laugh he came into the room
he had foreseen the excitement having caught sight of the kittens when heidi came in
the scene was a very peaceful one now clara held the little kittens in her lap and heidi was kneeling beside her
they both played happily with the two graceful creatures
the butler promised to look after the newcomers and prepared a bed for them in a basket
a long time afterwards when it was time to go to bed miss
rottenmeier cautiously opened the door
are they away
yes replied the butler quickly seizing the kittens and taking them away
the lecture that miss rottenmeier was going to give heidi was postponed to the following day for the lady was too much exhausted after her fright
they all went quietly to bed and the children were happy in the thought that their kittens had a comfortable bed
illustration
great disturbances in the sesemann house
a short time after the tutor had arrived next morning the doorbell rang so violently that sebastian thought it must be mr
sesemann himself
what was his surprise when a dirty streetboy with a barrelorgan on his back stood before him
what do you mean by pulling the bell like that
the butler said
i want to see clara
cant you at least say miss clara you ragged urchin
sebastian harshly
she owes me forty pennies said the boy
you are crazy
how do you know miss clara lives here
i showed her the way yesterday and she promised to give me forty pennies
what nonsense
miss clara never goes out
you had better take yourself off before i send you
the boy however did not even budge and said i saw her
she has curly hair black eyes and talks in a funny way
oh sebastian chuckled to himself that was the little miss
pulling the boy into the house he said all right you can follow me
wait at the door till i call you and then you can play something for miss clara
knocking at the studydoor sebastian said when he had entered a boy is here who wants to see miss clara
clara delighted at his interruption said cant he come right up
but the boy was already inside and started to play
miss rottenmeier was in the adjoining room when she heard the sounds
where did they come from
hurrying into the study she saw the streetboy playing to the eager children
she called but in vain for the music drowned her voice
suddenly she made a big jump for there between her feet crawled a black turtle
only when she shrieked for sebastian could her voice be heard
the butler came straight in for he had seen everything behind the door and a great scene it had been
glued to a chair in her fright miss rottenmeier called send the boy away
take them away
sebastian obediently pulled the boy after him then he said here are forty pennies from miss clara and forty more for playing
it was well done my boy
with that he closed the door behind him
miss rottenmeier found it wiser now to stay in the study to prevent further disturbances
suddenly there was another knock at the door
sebastian appeared with a large basket which had been brought for clara
we had better have our lesson before we inspect it said miss
rottenmeier
but clara turning to the tutor asked oh please mr
candidate cant we just peep in to see what it is
i am afraid that you will think of nothing else the teacher began
just then something in the basket which had been only lightly fastened moved and one two three and still more little kittens jumped out scampering around the room with the utmost speed
they bounded over the tutors boots and bit his trousers they climbed up on miss rottenmeiers dress and crawled around her feet
mewing and running they caused a frightful confusion
clara called out in delight oh look at the cunning creatures look how they jump
heidi look at that one and oh see the one over there
heidi followed them about while the teacher shook them off
when the housekeeper had collected her wits after the great fright she called for the servants
they soon arrived and stored the little kittens safely in the new bed
no time had been found for yawning that day either
when miss rottenmeier who had found out the culprit was alone with the children in the evening she began severely adelheid there is only one punishment for you
i am going to send you to the cellar to think over your dreadful misdeeds in company with the rats
a cellar held no terrors for heidi for in her grandfathers cellar fresh milk and the good cheese had been kept and no rats had lodged there
but clara shrieked oh miss rottenmeier you must wait till papa comes home and then he can punish heidi
the lady unwillingly replied all right clara but i shall also speak a few words to mr
with those words she left the room
since the childs arrival everything had been upset and the lady often felt discouraged though nothing remarkable happened for a few days
clara on the contrary enjoyed her companions society for she always did funny things
in her lesson she could never get her letters straight
they meant absolutely nothing to her except that they would remind her of goats and eagles
the girls always spent their evenings together and heidi would entertain her friend with tales of her former life till her longing grew so great that she added i have to go home now
i must go tomorrow
claras soothing words and the prospect of more rolls for the grandmother kept the child
every day after dinner she was left alone in her room for some hours
thinking of the green fields at home of the sparkling flowers on the mountains she would sit in a corner till her desire for all those things became too great to bear
her aunt had clearly told her that she might return if she wished to do so so one day she resolved to leave for the almhut
in a great hurry she packed the bread in the red shawl and putting on her old straw hat started off
the poor child did not get very far
at the door she encountered
miss rottenmeier who stared at heidi in mute surprise
what are you up to
she exploded
havent i forbidden you to run away
you look like a vagabond
i was only going home whispered the frightened child
what you want to run away from this house
what would mr
sesemann say
what is it that does not suit you here
dont you get better treatment than you deserve
have you ever before had such food service and such a room
no was the reply
dont i know that
the furious lady proceeded
what a thankless child you are just idle and goodfornothing
but heidi could not bear it any longer
she loudly wailed oh i want to go home
what will poor snowhopper do without me
grandmother is waiting for me every day
poor thistlefinch gets blows if peter gets no cheese and i must see the sun again when he says goodnight to the mountains
how the eagle would screech if he saw all the people here in frankfurt
for mercys sake the child is crazy
exclaimed miss rottenmeier running up the stairs
in her hurry she had bumped into sebastian who was just then coming down
bring the unlucky child up
she called to him rubbing her head
all right many thanks answered the butler rubbing his head too for he had encountered something far harder than she had
when the butler came down he saw heidi standing near the door with flaming eyes trembling all over
cheerfully he asked what has happened little one
do not take it to heart and cheer up
she nearly made a hole in my head just now but we must not get discouraged
come up with you she said so
heidi walked upstairs very slowly
seeing her so changed sebastian said dont give in
dont be so sad
you have been so courageous till now
i have never heard you cry yet
come up now and when the ladys away well go and look at the kittens
they are running round like wild
nodding cheerlessly the child disappeared in her room
that night at supper miss rottenmeier watched heidi constantly but nothing happened
the child sat as quiet as a mouse hardly touching her food except the little roll
talking with the tutor next morning miss rottenmeier told him her fears about heidis mind
but the teacher had more serious troubles still for heidi had not even learned her abc in all this time
heidi was sorely in need of some clothes so clara had given her some
miss rottenmeier was just busy arranging the childs wardrobe when she suddenly returned
adelheid she said contemptuously what do i find
a big pile of bread in your wardrobe
i never heard the like
yes clara it is true
then calling tinette she ordered her to take away the bread and the old straw hat she had found
i must keep my hat
the bread is for grandmother cried
heidi in despair
you stay here while we take the rubbish away said the lady sternly
heidi threw herself down now on claras chair and sobbed as if her heart would break
now i cant bring grandmother any rolls
oh they were for grandmother
she lamented
heidi dont cry any more clara begged
when you go home some day i am going to give you as many rolls as you had and more
they will be much softer and better than those stale ones you have kept
those were not fit to eat heidi
stop now please and dont cry any more
only after a long long time did heidi become quiet
when she had heard claras promise she cried are you really going to give me as many as i had
at supper heidis eyes were swollen and it was still hard for her to keep from crying
sebastian made strange signs to her that she did not understand
what did he mean
later though when she climbed into her high bed she found her old beloved straw hat hidden under her cover
so sebastian had saved it for her and had tried to tell her
she crushed it for joy and wrapping it in a handkerchief she hid it in the furthest corner of her wardrobe
the master of the house hears of strange doings
a few days afterwards there was great excitement in the sesemann residence for the master of the house had just arrived
the servants were taking upstairs one load after another for mr
sesemann always brought many lovely things home with him
when he entered his daughters room heidi shyly retreated into a corner
he greeted clara affectionately and she was equally delighted to see him for she loved her father dearly
then he called to heidi oh there is our little swiss girl
come and give me your hand
thats right
are you good friends my girls tell me now
you dont fight together what
oh no clara is always kind to me heidi replied
heidi has never even tried to fight papa clara quickly remarked
thats good i like to hear that said the father rising
i must get my dinner now for i am hungry
i shall come back soon and show you what i have brought home with me
in the diningroom he found miss rottenmeier surveying the table with a most tragic face
you do not look very happy at my arrival miss
rottenmeier
what is the matter
clara seems well enough he said to her
sesemann we have been terribly disappointed said the lady
how do you mean
sesemann calmly sipping his wine
we had decided as you know to have a companion for clara
knowing as i did that you would wish me to get a noble pure child i thought of this swiss child hoping she would go through life like a breath of pure air hardly touching the earth
i think that even swiss children are made to touch the earth otherwise they would have to have wings
i think you understand what i mean
i have been terribly disappointed for this child has brought the most frightful animals into the house
candidate can tell you
the child does not look very terrible
but what do you mean
i cannot explain it because she does not seem in her right mind at times
sesemann was getting worried at last when the tutor entered
candidate i hope you will explain
please take a cup of coffee with me and tell me about my daughters companion
make it short if you please
but this was impossible for mr
candidate who had to greet mr
sesemann first
then he began to reassure his host about the child pointing out to him that her education had been neglected till then and so on
but poor mr
sesemann unfortunately did not get his answer and had to listen to very longwinded explanations of the childs character
at last mr
sesemann got up saying excuse me
candidate but i must go over to clara now
he found the children in the study
turning to heidi who had risen at his approach he said come little one get meget me a glass of water
fresh water
of course fresh water he replied
when heidi had gone he sat down near clara holding her hand
tell me little clara he asked please tell me clearly what animals heidi has brought into the house is she really not right in her mind
clara now began to relate to her father all the incidents with the kittens and the turtle and explained heidis speeches that had so frightened the lady
sesemann laughed heartily and asked clara if she wished heidi to remain
of course papa
since she is here something amusing happens every day it used to be so dull but now heidi keeps me company
very good very good clara oh
here is your friend back again
did you get nice fresh water
heidi handed him the glass and said yes fresh from the fountain
you did not go to the fountain yourself heidi
said clara
certainly but i had to get it from far there were so many people at the first and at the second fountain
i had to go down another street and there i got it
a gentleman with white hair sends his regards to you mr
claras father laughed and asked who was the gentleman
when he passed by the fountain and saw me there with a glass he stood still and said please give me to drink for you have a glass to whom are you bringing the water
then i said i am bringing it to
when he heard that he laughed very loud and gave me his regards for you with the wish that you would enjoy your drink
i wonder who it was
what did the gentleman look like
he has a friendly laugh and wears a gold pendant with a red stone on his thick gold chain there is a horsehead on his cane
oh that was the doctor that was my old doctor exclaimed father and daughter at the same time
in the evening mr
sesemann told miss rottenmeier that heidi was going to remain for the children were very fond of each other and he found heidi normal and very sweet
i want the child to be treated kindly mr
sesemann added decidedly
her peculiarities must not be punished
my mother is coming very soon to stay here and she will help you to manage the child for there is nobody in this world that my mother could not get along with as you know miss rottenmeier
of course i know that mr
sesemann replied the lady but she was not very much pleased at the prospect
sesemann only stayed two weeks for his business called him back to paris
he consoled his daughter by telling her that his mother was coming in a very few days
sesemann had hardly left when the grandmothers visit was announced for the following day
clara was looking forward to this visit and told heidi so much about her dear grandmama that heidi also began to call her by that name to
miss rottenmeiers disapproval who thought that the child was not entitled to this intimacy
illustration
a grandmama
the following evening great expectation reigned in the house
tinette had put on a new cap sebastian was placing footstools in front of nearly every armchair and miss rottenmeier walked with great dignity about the house inspecting everything
when the carriage at last drove up the servants flew downstairs followed by miss rottenmeier in more measured step
heidi had been sent to her room to await further orders but it was not long before
tinette opened the door and said brusquely go into the study
the grandmama with her kind and loving way immediately befriended the child and made her feel as if she had known her always
to the housekeepers great mortification she called the child heidi remarking to miss rottenmeier if somebodys name is heidi i call her so
the housekeeper soon found that she had to respect the grandmothers ways and opinions
sesemann always knew what was going on in the house the minute she entered it
on the following afternoon clara was resting and the old lady had shut her eyes for five minutes when she got up again and went into the diningroom
with a suspicion that the housekeeper was probably asleep she went to this ladys room knocking loudly on the door
after a while somebody stirred inside and with a bewildered face miss rottenmeier appeared staring at the unexpected visitor
rottenmeier where is the child
how does she pass her time
i want to know said mrs
i should do exactly the same thing if i were left alone like that
please bring her to my room now i want to show her some pretty books
i have brought with me
that is just the trouble
what should she do with books
in all this time she has not even learned the abc for it is impossible to instil any knowledge into this being
candidate was not as patient as an angel he would have given up teaching her long ago
how strange
the child does not look to me like one who cannot learn the abc said mrs
please fetch her now we can look at the pictures anyway
the housekeeper was going to say more but the old lady had turned already and gone to her room
she was thinking over what she had heard about heidi making up her mind to look into the matter
heidi had come and was looking with wondering eyes at the splendid pictures in the large books that grandmama was showing her
suddenly she screamed aloud for there on the picture she saw a peaceful flock grazing on a green pasture
in the middle a shepherd was standing leaning on his crook
the setting sun was shedding a golden light over everything
with glowing eyes heidi devoured the scene but suddenly she began to sob violently
the grandmama took her little hand in hers and said in the most soothing voice come child you must not cry
did this remind you of something
now stop and ill tell you the story tonight
there are lovely stories in this book that people can read and tell
dry your tears now darling i must ask you something
stand up now and look at me
now we are merry again
heidi did not stop at once but the kind lady gave her ample time to compose herself saying from time to time now its all over
now well be merry again
when the child was quiet at last she said tell me now how your lessons are going
what have you learnt child tell me
nothing heidi sighed but i knew that i never could learn it
what is it that you cant learn
i cant learn to read it is too hard
who gave you this information
peter told me and he tried over and over again but he could not do it for it is too hard
well what kind of boy is he
heidi you must not believe what peter tells you but try for yourself
i am sure you had your thoughts elsewhere when mr
candidate showed you the letters
its no use heidi said with such a tone as if she was resigned to her fate
i am going to tell you something heidi said the kind lady now
you have not learnt to read because you have believed what peter said
you shall believe me now and i prophesy that you will learn it in a very short time as a great many other children do that are like you and not like peter
when you can read i am going to give you this book
you have seen the shepherd on the green pasture and then youll be able to find out all the strange things that happen to him
yes you can hear the whole story and what he does with his sheep and his goats
you would like to know wouldnt you heidi
heidi had listened attentively and said now with sparkling eyes if
i could only read already
it wont be long i can see that
come now and let us go to clara
with that they both went over to the study
since the day of heidis attempted flight a great change had come over the child
she had realized that it would hurt her kind friends if she tried to go home again
she knew now that she could not leave as her
aunt deta had promised for they all especially clara and her father and the old lady would think her ungrateful
but the burden grew heavier in her heart and she lost her appetite and got paler and paler
she could not get to sleep at night from longing to see the mountains with the flowers and the sunshine and only in her dreams she would be happy
when she woke up in the morning she always found herself on her high white bed far away from home
burying her head in her pillow she would often weep a long long time
sesemann had noticed the childs unhappiness but let a few days pass by hoping for a change
but the change never came and often
heidis eyes were red even in the early morning
so she called the child to her room one day and said with great sympathy in her voice tell me heidi what is the matter with you
what is making you so sad
but as heidi did not want to appear thankless she replied sadly i cant tell you
cant you tell clara perhaps
oh no i cant tell anyone heidi said looking so unhappy that the old ladys heart was filled with pity
i tell you something little girl she continued
if you have a sorrow that you cannot tell to anyone you can go to our father in
you can tell him everything that troubles you and if we ask
him he can help us and take our suffering away
do you understand me child
dont you pray every night
dont you thank him for all his gifts and ask him to protect you from evil
oh no i never do that replied the child
have you never prayed heidi
do you know what i mean
i only prayed with my first grandmother but it is so long ago that
i have forgotten
see heidi i understand now why you are so unhappy
we all need somebody to help us and just think how wonderful it is to be able to go to the lord when something distresses us and causes us pain
we can tell him everything and ask him to comfort us when nobody else can do it
he can give us happiness and joy
heidi was gladdened by these tidings and asked can we tell him everything everything
yes heidi everything
the child withdrawing her hand from the grandmama said hurriedly can i go now
yes of course was the reply and with this heidi ran to her room
sitting down on a stool she folded her hands and poured out her heart to god imploring him to help her and let her go home to her grandfather
about a week later mr
candidate asked to see mrs
sesemann to tell her of something unusual that had occurred
being called to the ladys room he began mrs
sesemann something has happened that i never expected and with many more words the happy grandmama was told that
heidi had suddenly learned to read with the utmost correctness most rare with beginners
many strange things happen in this world mrs
sesemann remarked while they went over to the study to witness heidis new accomplishment
heidi was sitting close to clara reading her a story she seemed amazed at the strange new world that had opened up before her
at supper heidi found the large book with the beautiful pictures on her plate and looking doubtfully at grandmama she saw the old lady nod
now it belongs to you heidi she said
also when i am going home
heidi inquired confused with joy
certainly forever
the grandmama assured her
tomorrow we shall begin to read it
but heidi you must not go home no not for many years clara exclaimed especially when grandmama goes away
you must stay with me
heidi still looked at her book before going to bed that night and this book became her dearest treasure
she would look at the beautiful pictures and read all the stories aloud to clara
grandmama would quietly listen and explain something here and there making it more beautiful than before
heidi loved the pictures with the shepherd best of all they told the story of the prodigal son and the child would read and reread it till she nearly knew it all by heart
since heidi had learned to read and possessed the book the days seemed to fly and the time had come near that the grandmama had fixed for her departure
heidi gains in some respects and loses in others
the grandmama sent for heidi every day after dinner while clara was resting and miss rottenmeier disappeared into her room
she talked to
heidi and amused her in various ways showing her how to make clothes for pretty little dolls that she had brought
unconsciously heidi had learned to sew and made now the sweetest dresses and coats for the little people out of lovely materials the grandmama would give her
often heidi would read to the old lady for the oftener she read over the stories the dearer they became to her
the child lived everything through with the people in the tales and was always happy to be with them again
but she never looked really cheerful and her eyes never sparkled merrily as before
in the last week of mrs
sesemanns stay heidi was called again to the old ladys room
the child entered with her beloved book under her arm
sesemann drew heidi close to her and laying the book aside she said come child and tell me why you are so sad
do you still have the same sorrow
yes heidi replied
did you confide it to our lord
do you pray to him every day that he may make you happy again and take your affliction away
oh no i dont pray any more
what do i hear heidi
why dont you pray
it does not help for god has not listened
i dont wonder she added for if all the people in frankfurt pray every night he cannot listen to them all
i am sure he has not heard me
why are you so sure
because i have prayed for the same thing many many weeks and god has not done what i have asked him to
that is not the way heidi
you see god in heaven is a good father to all of us who knows what we need better than we do
when something we ask for is not very good for us he gives us something much better if we confide in him and do not lose confidence in his love
he heard your prayers and said to himself yes heidi shall get what she is praying for in time
now while god was looking down on you to hear your prayers you lost confidence and went away from him
if god does not hear your prayers any more he will forget you also and let you go
dont you want to go back to him heidi and ask his forgiveness
pray to him every day and hope in him that he may bring cheer and happiness to you
heidi had listened attentively she had unbounded confidence in the old lady whose words had made a deep impression on her
full of repentance she said i shall go at once and ask our father to pardon me
i shall never forget him any more
thats right heidi i am sure he will help you in time if you only trust in him the grandmother consoled her
heidi went to her room now and prayed earnestly to god that he would forgive her and fulfill her wish
the day of departure had come but mrs
sesemann arranged everything in such a way that the children hardly realized she was actually going
still everything was empty and quiet when she had gone and the children hardly knew how to pass their time
next day heidi came to clara in the afternoon and said can i always always read to you now clara
clara assented and heidi began
but she did not get very far for the story she was reading told of a grandmothers death
suddenly she cried aloud oh now grandmother is dead
and wept in the most pitiful fashion
whatever heidi read always seemed real to her and now she thought it was her own grandmother at home
louder and louder she sobbed now poor grandmother is dead and i can never see her any more and she never got one single roll
clara attempted to explain the mistake but heidi was too much upset
she pictured to herself how terrible it would be if her dear old grandfather would die too while she was far away
how quiet and empty it would be in the hut and how lonely she would be
miss rottenmeier had overheard the scene and approaching the sobbing child she said impatiently adelheid now you have screamed enough
if i hear you again giving way to yourself in such a noisy fashion i shall take your book away forever
heidi turned pale at that for the book was her greatest treasure
quickly drying her tears she choked down her sobs
after that heidi never cried again often she could hardly repress her sobs and was obliged to make the strangest faces to keep herself from crying out
clara often looked at her full of surprise but miss rottenmeier did not notice them and found no occasion to carry out her threat
however the poor child got more cheerless every day and looked so thin and pale that sebastian became worried
he tried to encourage her at table to help herself to all the good dishes but listlessly she would let them pass and hardly touch them
in the evening she would cry quietly her heart bursting with longing to go home
thus the time passed by
heidi never knew if it was summer or winter for the walls opposite never changed
they drove out very seldom for
clara was only able to go a short distance
they never saw anything else than streets houses and busy people no grass no firtrees and no mountains
heidi struggled constantly against her sorrow but in vain
autumn and winter had passed and heidi knew that the time was coming when peter would go up the alp with his goats where the flowers were glistening in the sunshine and the mountains were all afire
she would sit down in a corner of her room and put both hands before her eyes not to see the glaring sunshine on the opposite wall
there she would remain eating her heart away with longing till clara would call for her to come
illustration illustration there she would remain eating her heart away with
the sesemann house is haunted
for several days miss rottenmeier had been wandering silently about the house
when she went from room to room or along the corridors she would often glance back as if she were afraid that somebody was following her
if she had to go to the upper floor where the gorgeous guestrooms were or to the lower story where the big ballroom was situated she always told tinette to come with her
the strange thing was that none of the servants dared to go anywhere alone and always found an excuse to ask each others company which requests were always granted
the cook who had been in the house for many years would often shake her head and mutter that i should live to see this
something strange and weird was happening in the house
every morning when the servants came downstairs they found the front door wide open
at first everybody had thought that the house must have been robbed but nothing was missing
every morning it was the same despite the double locks that were put on the door
at last john and
sebastian taking courage prepared themselves to watch through a night to see who was the ghost
armed and provided with some strengthening liquor they repaired to a room downstairs
first they talked but soon getting sleepy they leaned silently back in their chairs
when the clock from the old church tower struck one sebastian awoke and roused his comrade which was no easy matter
at last however john was wide awake and together they went out into the hall
the same moment a strong wind put out the light that john held in his hand
rushing back he nearly upset sebastian who stood behind him and pulling the butler back into the room he locked the door in furious haste
when the light was lit again sebastian noticed that
john was deadly pale and trembling like an aspen leaf
sebastian not having seen anything asked anxiously what is the matter
what did you see
the door was open and a white form was on the stairs it went up and was gone in a moment gasped john
cold shivers ran down the butlers back
they sat without moving till the morning came and then shutting the door they went upstairs to report to the housekeeper what they had seen
the lady who was waiting eagerly heard the tale and immediately sat down to write to mr
she told him that fright had paralyzed her fingers and that terrible things were happening in the house
then followed a tale of the appearance of the ghost
sesemann replied that he could not leave his business and advised miss rottenmeier to ask his mother to come to stay with them for mrs
sesemann would easily despatch the ghost
miss rottenmeier was offended with the tone of the letter which did not seem to take her account seriously
sesemann also replied that she could not come so the housekeeper decided to tell the children all about it
clara at the uncanny tale immediately exclaimed that she would not stay alone another moment and that she wished her father to come home
the housekeeper arranged to sleep with the frightened child while
heidi who did not know what ghosts were was perfectly unmoved
another letter was despatched to mr
this brought mr
going to his daughters room after his arrival he was overjoyed to see her as well as ever
clara was also delighted to see her father
what new tricks has the ghost played on you miss rottenmeier
sesemann with a twinkle in his eye
it is no joke mr
sesemann replied the lady seriously
i am sure you will not laugh tomorrow
those strange events indicate that something secret and horrible has happened in this house in days gone by
is that so
this is new to me remarked mr
but will you please not suspect my venerable ancestors
please call sebastian i want to speak to him alone
sesemann knew that the two were not on good terms so he said to the butler come here sebastian and tell me honestly if you have played the ghost for miss rottenmeiers pastime
no upon my word master you must not think that replied sebastian frankly
i do not like it quite myself
well ill show you and john what ghosts look like by day
you ought to be ashamed of yourselves strong young men like you
now go at once to my old friend dr
classen and tell him to come to me at nine oclock tonight
tell him that i came from paris especially to consult him and that i want him to sit up all night with me
do you understand me sebastian
yes indeed
i shall do as you say mr
sesemann then went up to claras room to quiet and comfort her
punctually at nine oclock the doctor arrived
though his hair was grey his face was still fresh and his eyes were lively and kind
when he saw his friend he laughed aloud and said well well you look pretty healthy for one who needs to be watched all night
have patience my old friend replied mr
i am afraid the person we have to sit up for will look worse but first we must catch him
then somebody is sick in this house
what do you mean
far worse doctor far worse
a ghost is in the house
my house is haunted
when the doctor laughed mr
sesemann continued i call that sympathy i wish my friend miss rottenmeier could hear you
she is convinced that an old sesemann is wandering about expiating some dreadful deed
how did she make his acquaintance
asked the doctor much amused
sesemann then explained the circumstances
with these explanations they entered the room where the two servants had watched before
a few bottles of wine stood on the table and two bright candelabra shed a brilliant light
two revolvers were ready for emergencies
they left the door only partly open for too much light might drive the ghost away
then sitting down comfortably the two men passed their time by chatting taking a sip now and then
the ghost seems to have spied us and probably wont come today said the doctor
we must have patience
it is supposed to come at one replied his friend
so they talked till one oclock
everything was quiet and not a sound came from the street
suddenly the doctor raised his finger
sesemann dont you hear something
while they both listened the bar was unfastened the key was turned and the door flew open
sesemann seized his revolver
you are not afraid i hope
said the doctor getting up
better be cautious
whispered mr
sesemann seizing the candelabrum in the other hand
the doctor followed with his revolver and the light and so they went out into the hall
on the threshhold stood a motionless white form lighted up by the moon
who is there
thundered the doctor approaching the figure
it turned and uttered a low shriek
there stood heidi with bare feet and in her white nightgown looking bewildered at the bright light and the weapons
she was shaking with fear while the two men were looking at her in amazement
sesemann this seems to be your little water carrier said the doctor
child what does this mean
what did you want to do
why have you come down here
pale from fright heidi said i do not know
the doctor came forward now
sesemann this case belongs to my field
please go and sit down while i take her to bed
putting his revolver aside he led the trembling child upstairs
dont be afraid just be quiet
everything is all right dont be frightened
when they had arrived in heidis room the doctor put the little girl to bed covering her up carefully
drawing a chair near the couch he waited till heidi had calmed down and had stopped trembling
then taking her hand in his he said kindly now everything is all right again
tell me where you wanted to go
i did not want to go anywhere heidi assured him i did not go myself only i was there all of a sudden
tell me what did you dream
oh i have the same dream every night
i always think i am with my grandfather again and can hear the firtrees roar
i always think how beautiful the stars must be and then i open the door of the hut and oh it is so wonderful
but when i wake up i am always in frankfurt
heidi had to fight the sobs that were rising in her throat
does your back or your head hurt you child
no but i feel as if a big stone was pressing me here
as if you had eaten something that disagreed with you
oh no but as if i wanted to cry hard
so and then you cry out dont you
oh no i must never do that for miss rottenmeier has forbidden it
then you swallow it down
do you like to be here
oh yes was the faint uncertain reply
where did you live with your grandfather
up on the alp
but wasnt it a little lonely there
oh no it was so beautiful
but heidi could say no more
the recollection the excitement of the night and all the restrained sorrow overpowered the child
the tears rushed violently from her eyes and she broke out into loud sobs
the doctor rose and soothing her said it wont hurt to cry youll go to sleep afterward and when you wake up everything will come right
then he left the room
joining his anxious friend downstairs he said sesemann the little girl is a sleepwalker and has unconsciously scared your whole household
besides she is so homesick that her little body has wasted away
we shall have to act quickly
the only remedy for her is to be restored to her native mountain air
this is my prescription and she must go tomorrow
what sick a sleepwalker and wasted away in my house
nobody even suspected it
you think i should send this child back in this condition when she has come in good health
no doctor ask everything but that
take her in hand and prescribe for her but let her get well before i send her back
sesemann the doctor replied seriously just think what you are doing
we cannot cure her with powders and pills
the child has not a strong constitution and if you keep her here she might never get well again
if you restore her to the bracing mountain air to which she is accustomed she probably will get perfectly well again
sesemann heard this he said if that is your advice we must act at once this is the only way then
with these words mr
sesemann took his friends arm and walked about with him to talk the matter over
when everything was settled the doctor took his leave for the morning had already come and the sun was shining in through the door
up the alp on a summer evening
sesemann going upstairs in great agitation knocked at the housekeepers door
he asked her to hurry for preparations for a journey had to be made
miss rottenmeier obeyed the summons with the greatest indignation for it was only halfpast four in the morning
she dressed in haste though with great difficulty being nervous and excited
all the other servants were summoned likewise and one and all thought that the master of the house had been seized by the ghost and that he was ringing for help
when they had all come down with terrified looks they were most surprised to see mr
sesemann fresh and cheerful giving orders
john was sent to get the horses ready and
tinette was told to prepare heidi for her departure while sebastian was commissioned to fetch heidis aunt
sesemann instructed the housekeeper to pack a trunk in all haste for heidi
miss rottenmeier experienced an extreme disappointment for she had hoped for an explanation of the great mystery
sesemann evidently not in the mood to converse further went to his daughters room
clara had been wakened by the unusual noises and was listening eagerly
her father told her of what had happened and how the doctor had ordered heidi back to her home because her condition was serious and might get worse
she might even climb the roof or be exposed to similar dangers if she was not cured at once
clara was painfully surprised and tried to prevent her father from carrying out his plan
he remained firm however promising to take her to switzerland himself the following summer if she was good and sensible now
so the child resigning herself begged to have heidis trunk packed in her room
sesemann encouraged her to get together a good outfit for her little friend
heidis aunt had arrived in the meantime
being told to take her niece home with her she found no end of excuses which plainly showed that she did not want to do it for deta well remembered the uncles parting words
sesemann dismissed her and summoned sebastian
the butler was told to get ready for travelling with the child
he was to go to basle that day and spend the night at a good hotel which his master named
the next day the child was to be brought to her home
listen sebastian mr
sesemann said and do exactly as i tell you
i know the hotel in basle and if you show my card they will give you good accommodations
go to the childs room and barricade the windows so that they can only be opened by the greatest force
when heidi has gone to bed lock the door from outside for the child walks in her sleep and might come to harm in the strange hotel
she might get up and open the door do you understand
so it was she
exclaimed the butler
yes it was
you are a coward and you can tell john he is the same
such foolish men to be afraid
with that mr
sesemann went to his room to write a letter to heidis grandfather
sebastian feeling ashamed said to himself that he ought to have resisted john and found out alone
heidi was dressed in her sunday frock and stood waiting for further commands
sesemann called her now
goodmorning mr
sesemann heidi said when she entered
what do you think about it little one
he asked her
heidi looked up to him in amazement
you dont seem to know anything about it laughed mr
tinette had not even told the child for she thought it beneath her dignity to speak to the vulgar heidi
you are going home today
heidi repeated in a low voice
she had to gasp so great was her surprise
wouldnt you like to hear something about it
sesemann smiling
oh yes i should like to said the blushing child
good good said the kind gentleman
sit down and eat a big breakfast now for you are going away right afterwards
the child could not even swallow a morsel though she tried to eat out of obedience
it seemed to her as if it was only a dream
