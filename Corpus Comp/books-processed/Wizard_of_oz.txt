to my readers
its no use no use at all
the children wont let me stop telling tales of the land of oz
i know lots of other stories and i hope to tell them some time or another but just now my loving tyrants wont allow me
they cry ozoz
more about oz mr
and what can i do but obey their commands
this is our bookmine and the childrens
for they have flooded me with thousands of suggestions in regard to it and i have honestly tried to adopt as many of these suggestions as could be fitted into one story
after the wonderful success of ozma of oz it is evident that dorothy has become a firm fixture in these oz stories
the little ones all love
dorothy and as one of my small friends aptly states it isnt a real
oz story without her
so here she is again as sweet and gentle and innocent as ever i hope and the heroine of another strange adventure
there were many requests from my little correspondents for more about the wizard
it seems the jolly old fellow made hosts of friends in the first oz book in spite of the fact that he frankly acknowledged himself a humbug
the children had heard how he mounted into the sky in a balloon and they were all waiting for him to come down again
so what could i do but tell what happened to the wizard afterward
you will find him in these pages just the same humbug wizard as before
there was one thing the children demanded which i found it impossible to do in this present book they bade me introduce toto dorothys little black dog who has many friends among my readers
but you will see when you begin to read the story that toto was in kansas while dorothy was in california and so she had to start on her adventure without him
in this book dorothy had to take her kitten with her instead of her dog but in the next oz book if i am permitted to write one i intend to tell a good deal about totos further history
princess ozma whom i love as much as my readers do is again introduced in this story and so are several of our old friends of oz
you will also become acquainted with jim the cabhorse the nine tiny piglets and eureka the kitten
i am sorry the kitten was not as well behaved as she ought to have been but perhaps she wasnt brought up properly
dorothy found her you see and who her parents were nobody knows
i believe my dears that i am the proudest storyteller that ever lived
many a time tears of pride and joy have stood in my eyes while i read the tender loving appealing letters that come to me in almost every mail from my little readers
to have pleased you to have interested you to have won your friendship and perhaps your love through my stories is to my mind as great an achievement as to become
president of the united states
indeed i would much rather be your storyteller under these conditions than to be the president
so you have helped me to fulfill my lifes ambition and i am more grateful to you my dears than i can express in words
i try to answer every letter of my young correspondents yet sometimes there are so many letters that a little time must pass before you get your answer
but be patient friends for the answer will surely come and by writing to me you more than repay me for the pleasant task of preparing these books

list of chapters
the earthquake
the train from frisco was very late
as it came to a stop the conductor called out in a loud voice hugsons siding
the conductor helped her off the car and then the engineer started his train again so that it puffed and groaned and moved slowly away up the track
so he moved the cars slowly and with caution
the little girl stood still to watch until the train had disappeared around a curve then she turned to see where she was
the shed at hugsons siding was bare save for an old wooden bench and did not look very inviting
she walked toward it and found the horse tied to a tree and standing motionless with its head hanging down almost to the ground
it was a big horse tall and bony with long legs and large knees and feet
she could count his ribs easily where they showed through the skin of his body and his head was long and seemed altogether too big for him as if it did not fit
his tail was short and scraggly and his harness had been broken in many places and fastened together again with cords and bits of wire
the buggy seemed almost new for it had a shiny top and side curtains
getting around in front so that she could look inside the girl saw a boy curled up on the seat fast asleep
she set down the birdcage and poked the boy with her parasol
presently he woke up rose to a sitting position and rubbed his eyes briskly
he said seeing her are you dorothy gale
yes she answered looking gravely at his tousled hair and blinking gray eyes
have you come to take me to hugsons ranch
of course he answered
i couldnt be here if it wasnt she said
he laughed at that and his laugh was merry and frank
jumping out of the buggy he put dorothys suitcase under the seat and her birdcage on the floor in front
canarybirds
oh no its just eureka my kitten
i thought that was the best way to carry her
the boy nodded
eurekas a funny name for a cat he remarked
i named my kitten that because i found it she explained
uncle henry says eureka means i have found it
all right hop in
she climbed into the buggy and he followed her
then the boy picked up the reins shook them and said giddap
the horse did not stir
dorothy thought he just wiggled one of his drooping ears but that was all
called the boy again
the horse stood still
perhaps said dorothy if you untied him he would go
the boy laughed cheerfully and jumped out
guess im half asleep yet he said untying the horse
but jim knows his business all rightdont you jim
patting the long nose of the animal
then he got into the buggy again and took the reins and the horse at once backed away from the tree turned slowly around and began to trot down the sandy road which was just visible in the dim light
thought that train would never come observed the boy
ive waited at that station for five hours
we had a lot of earthquakes said dorothy
didnt you feel the ground shake
yes but were used to such things in california he replied
they dont scare us much
illustration dorothy poked the boy with her parasol
the conductor said it was the worst quake he ever knew
then it must have happened while i was asleep he said thoughtfully
how is uncle henry
she enquired after a pause during which the horse continued to trot with long regular strides
hes pretty well
he and uncle hugson have been having a fine visit
hugson your uncle
uncle bill hugson married your uncle henrys wifes sister so we must be second cousins said the boy in an amused tone
i work for
uncle bill on his ranch and he pays me six dollars a month and my board
isnt that a great deal
she asked doubtfully
why its a great deal for uncle hugson but not for me
im a splendid worker
i work as well as i sleep he added with a laugh
what is your name
asked dorothy thinking she liked the boys manner and the cheery tone of his voice
not a very pretty one he answered as if a little ashamed
my whole name is zebediah but folks just call me zeb
youve been to
australia havent you
yes with uncle henry she answered
we got to san francisco a week ago and uncle henry went right on to hugsons ranch for a visit while i stayed a few days in the city with some friends we had met
how long will you be with us
only a day
tomorrow uncle henry and i must start back for kansas
weve been away for a long time you know and so were anxious to get home again
the boy flicked the big boney horse with his whip and looked thoughtful
then he started to say something to his little companion but before he could speak the buggy began to sway dangerously from side to side and the earth seemed to rise up before them
next minute there was a roar and a sharp crash and at her side dorothy saw the ground open in a wide crack and then come together again
she cried grasping the iron rail of the seat
what was that
that was an awful big quake replied zeb with a white face
it almost got us that time dorothy
the horse had stopped short and stood firm as a rock
zeb shook the reins and urged him to go but jim was stubborn
then the boy cracked his whip and touched the animals flanks with it and after a low moan of protest jim stepped slowly along the road
neither the boy nor the girl spoke again for some minutes
there was a breath of danger in the very air and every few moments the earth would shake violently
jims ears were standing erect upon his head and every muscle of his big body was tense as he trotted toward home
he was not going very fast but on his flanks specks of foam began to appear and at times he would tremble like a leaf
the sky had grown darker again and the wind made queer sobbing sounds as it swept over the valley
suddenly there was a rending tearing sound and the earth split into another great crack just beneath the spot where the horse was standing
with a wild neigh of terror the animal fell bodily into the pit drawing the buggy and its occupants after him
dorothy grabbed fast hold of the buggy top and the boy did the same
the sudden rush into space confused them so that they could not think
the horrible sensation of falling the darkness and the terrifying noises proved more than dorothy could endure and for a few moments the little girl lost consciousness
zeb being a boy did not faint but he was badly frightened and clung to the buggy seat with a tight grip expecting every moment would be his last
illustration illustration
the glass city
when dorothy recovered her senses they were still falling but not so fast
the top of the buggy caught the air like a parachute or an umbrella filled with wind and held them back so that they floated downward with a gentle motion that was not so very disagreeable to bear
the worst thing was their terror of reaching the bottom of this great crack in the earth and the natural fear that sudden death was about to overtake them at any moment
crash after crash echoed far above their heads as the earth came together where it had split and stones and chunks of clay rattled around them on every side
these they could not see but they could feel them pelting the buggy top and jim screamed almost like a human being when a stone overtook him and struck his boney body
how long this state of things continued dorothy could not even guess she was so greatly bewildered
also turning her head she found that she could see the boy beside her who had until now remained as still and silent as she herself
dorothy sighed and commenced to breathe easier
with this thought in mind the girl took heart and leaned her head over the side of the buggy to see where the strange light was coming from
far below her she found six great glowing balls suspended in the air
the central and largest one was white and reminded her of the sun
around it were arranged like the five points of a star the other five brilliant balls one being rose colored one violet one yellow one blue and one orange
this splendid group of colored suns sent rays darting in every direction and as the horse and buggywith dorothy and
then she looked at zeb whose face was blue and whose hair was pink and gave a little laugh that sounded a bit nervous
isnt it funny
the boy was startled and his eyes were big
dorothy had a green streak through the center of her face where the blue and yellow lights came together and her appearance seemed to add to his fright
ii dont sssee anything funnybout it
he stammered
illustration horse buggy and all fell slowly
just then the buggy tipped slowly over upon its side the body of the horse tipping also
but they continued to fall all together and the boy and girl had no difficulty in remaining upon the seat just as they were before
then they turned bottom side up and continued to roll slowly over until they were right side up again
during this time jim struggled frantically all his legs kicking the air but on finding himself in his former position the horse said in a relieved tone of voice well thats better
dorothy and zeb looked at one another in wonder
can your horse talk
never knew him to before replied the boy
those were the first words i ever said called out the horse who had overheard them and i cant explain why i happened to speak then
this is a nice scrape youve got me into isnt it
as for that we are in the same scrape ourselves answered dorothy cheerfully
but never mind something will happen pretty soon
of course growled the horse and then we shall be sorry it happened
zeb gave a shiver
all this was so terrible and unreal that he could not understand it at all and so had good reason to be afraid
swiftly they drew near to the flaming colored suns and passed close beside them
the light was then so bright that it dazzled their eyes and they covered their faces with their hands to escape being blinded
there was no heat in the colored suns however and after they had passed below them the top of the buggy shut out many of the piercing rays so that the boy and girl could open their eyes again
weve got to come to the bottom some time remarked zeb with a deep sigh
we cant keep falling forever you know
of course not said dorothy
we are somewhere in the middle of the earth and the chances are well reach the other side of it before long
but its a big hollow isnt it
answered the boy
were coming to something now announced the horse
at this they both put their heads over the side of the buggy and looked down
yes there was land below them and not so very far away either
but they were floating very very slowlyso slowly that it could no longer be called a falland the children had ample time to take heart and look about them
they saw a landscape with mountains and plains lakes and rivers very like those upon the earths surface but all the scene was splendidly colored by the variegated lights from the six suns
here and there were groups of houses that seemed made of clear glass because they sparkled so brightly
im sure we are in no danger said dorothy in a sober voice
we are falling so slowly that we cant be dashed to pieces when we land and this country that we are coming to seems quite pretty
well never get home again though
declared zeb with a groan
oh im not so sure of that replied the girl
but dont let us worry over such things zeb we cant help ourselves just now you know and
ive always been told its foolish to borrow trouble
the boy became silent having no reply to so sensible a speech and soon both were fully occupied in staring at the strange scenes spread out below them
they seemed to be falling right into the middle of a big city which had many tall buildings with glass domes and sharppointed spires
these spires were like great spearpoints and if they tumbled upon one of them they were likely to suffer serious injury
jim the horse had seen these spires also and his ears stood straight up with fear while dorothy and zeb held their breaths in suspense
but no they floated gently down upon a broad flat roof and came to a stop at last
at once a pink kitten crept out of the upset cage sat down upon the glass roof and yawned and blinked its round eyes
oh said dorothy
theres eureka
first time i ever saw a pink cat said zeb
eureka isnt pink shes white
its this queer light that gives her that color
wheres my milk
asked the kitten looking up into dorothys face
im most starved to death
can you talk
am i talking
good gracious i believe i am
isnt it funny
asked the kitten
its all wrong said zeb gravely
animals ought not to talk
but even old jim has been saying things since we had our accident
i cant see that its wrong remarked jim in his gruff tones
at least it isnt as wrong as some other things
whats going to become of us now
i dont know answered the boy looking around him curiously
the houses of the city were all made of glass so clear and transparent that one could look through the walls as easily as though a window
dorothy saw underneath the roof on which she stood several rooms used for rest chambers and even thought she could make out a number of queer forms huddled into the corners of these rooms
the roof beside them had a great hole smashed through it and pieces of glass were lying scattered in every direction
a near by steeple had been broken off short and the fragments lay heaped beside it
other buildings were cracked in places or had corners chipped off from them but they must have been very beautiful before these accidents had happened to mar their perfection
the rainbow tints from the colored suns fell upon the glass city softly and gave to the buildings many delicate shifting hues which were very pretty to see
but not a sound had broken the stillness since the strangers had arrived except that of their own voices
they began to wonder if there were no people to inhabit this magnificent city of the inner world
suddenly a man appeared through a hole in the roof next to the one they were on and stepped into plain view
he was not a very large man but was well formed and had a beautiful facecalm and serene as the face of a fine portrait
his clothing fitted his form snugly and was gorgeously colored in brilliant shades of green which varied as the sunbeams touched them but was not wholly influenced by the solar rays
the man had taken a step or two across the glass roof before he noticed the presence of the strangers but then he stopped abruptly
cried dorothy who noticed that the beautiful man did not look where he was going be careful or youll fall off
but he paid no attention to her warning
he reached the edge of the tall roof stepped one foot out into the air and walked into space as calmly as if he were on firm ground
the girl greatly astonished ran to lean over the edge of the roof and saw the man walking rapidly through the air toward the ground
soon he reached the street and disappeared through a glass doorway into one of the glass buildings
how strange
she exclaimed drawing a long breath
yes but its lots of fun if it is strange remarked the small voice of the kitten and dorothy turned to find her pet walking in the air a foot or so away from the edge of the roof
come back eureka
she called in distress youll certainly be killed
does the air bear up your weight
asked the girl
of course cant you see
and again the kitten wandered into the air and back to the edge of the roof
its wonderful
said dorothy
suppose we let eureka go down to the street and get some one to help us suggested zeb who had been even more amazed than dorothy at these strange happenings
perhaps we can walk on the air ourselves replied the girl
zeb drew back with a shiver
i wouldnt dare try he said
may be jim will go continued dorothy looking at the horse
and may be he wont
answered jim
ive tumbled through the air long enough to make me contented on this roof
but we didnt tumble to the roof said the girl by the time we reached here we were floating very slowly and im almost sure we could float down to the street without getting hurt
eureka walks on the air all right
eureka weighs only about half a pound replied the horse in a scornful tone while i weigh about half a ton
you dont weigh as much as you ought to jim remarked the girl shaking her head as she looked at the animal
youre dreadfully skinny
oh well im old said the horse hanging his head despondently and
ive had lots of trouble in my day little one
for a good many years i drew a public cab in chicago and thats enough to make anyone skinny
he eats enough to get fat im sure said the boy gravely
can you remember any breakfast that ive had today
growled jim as if he resented zebs speech
none of us has had breakfast said the boy and in a time of danger like this its foolish to talk about eating
if there are they are liable to be glass oats
illustration come on jim
its all right
exclaimed dorothy
i can see plenty of nice gardens and fields down below us at the edge of this city
but i wish we could find a way to get to the ground
why dont you walk down
asked eureka
im as hungry as the horse is and i want my milk
will you try it zeb asked the girl turning to her companion
zeb hesitated
he was still pale and frightened for this dreadful adventure had upset him and made him nervous and worried
but he did not wish the little girl to think him a coward so he advanced slowly to the edge of the roof
dorothy stretched out a hand to him and zeb put one foot out and let it rest in the air a little over the edge of the roof
it seemed firm enough to walk upon so he took courage and put out the other foot
dorothy kept hold of his hand and followed him and soon they were both walking through the air with the kitten frisking beside them
come on jim
called the boy
its all right
jim had crept to the edge of the roof to look over and being a sensible horse and quite experienced he made up his mind that he could go where the others did
so with a snort and a neigh and a whisk of his short tail he trotted off the roof into the air and at once began floating downward to the street
his great weight made him fall faster than the children walked and he passed them on the way down but when he came to the glass pavement he alighted upon it so softly that he was not even jarred
said dorothy drawing a long breath what a strange country this is
people began to come out of the glass doors to look at the new arrivals and pretty soon quite a crowd had assembled
there were men and women but no children at all and the folks were all beautifully formed and attractively dressed and had wonderfully handsome faces
there was not an ugly person in all the throng yet dorothy was not especially pleased by the appearance of these people because their features had no more expression than the faces of dolls
they did not smile nor did they frown or show either fear or surprise or curiosity or friendliness
they simply stared at the strangers paying most attention to jim and
eureka for they had never before seen either a horse or a cat and the children bore an outward resemblance to themselves
pretty soon a man joined the group who wore a glistening star in the dark hair just over his forehead
he seemed to be a person of authority for the others pressed back to give him room
after turning his composed eyes first upon the animals and then upon the children he said to zeb who was a little taller than dorothy tell me intruder was it you who caused the rain of stones
for a moment the boy did not know what he meant by this question
then remembering the stones that had fallen with them and passed them long before they had reached this place he answered no sir we didnt cause anything
it was the earthquake
the man with the star stood for a time quietly thinking over this speech
then he asked what is an earthquake
i dont know said zeb who was still confused
but dorothy seeing his perplexity answered its a shaking of the earth
in this quake a big crack opened and we fell throughhorse and buggy and alland the stones got loose and came down with us
the man with the star regarded her with his calm expressionless eyes
the rain of stones has done much damage to our city he said and we shall hold you responsible for it unless you can prove your innocence
how can we do that
asked the girl
that i am not prepared to say
it is your affair not mine
you must go to the house of the sorcerer who will soon discover the truth
where is the house of the sorcerer
the girl enquired
i will lead you to it
he turned and walked down the street and after a moments hesitation
dorothy caught eureka in her arms and climbed into the buggy
the boy took his seat beside her and said giddap jim
as the horse ambled along drawing the buggy the people of the glass city made way for them and formed a procession in their rear
illustration
the arrival of the wizard
the doorway of the glass palace was quite big enough for the horse and buggy to enter so zeb drove straight through it and the children found themselves in a lofty hall that was very beautiful
the people at once followed and formed a circle around the sides of the spacious room leaving the horse and buggy and the man with the star to occupy the center of the hall
come to us oh gwig
called the man in a loud voice
instantly a cloud of smoke appeared and rolled over the floor then it slowly spread and ascended into the dome disclosing a strange personage seated upon a glass throne just before jims nose
he was formed just as were the other inhabitants of this land and his clothing only differed from theirs in being bright yellow
but he had no hair at all and all over his bald head and face and upon the backs of his hands grew sharp thorns like those found on the branches of rosebushes
there was even a thorn upon the tip of his nose and he looked so funny that dorothy laughed when she saw him
the sorcerer hearing the laugh looked toward the little girl with cold cruel eyes and his glance made her grow sober in an instant
why have you dared to intrude your unwelcome persons into the secluded
land of the mangaboos
he asked sternly
cause we couldnt help it said dorothy
why did you wickedly and viciously send the rain of stones to crack and break our houses
he continued
we didnt declared the girl
cried the sorcerer
we dont have to prove it answered dorothy indignantly
if you had any sense at all youd known it was the earthquake
we only know that yesterday came a rain of stones upon us which did much damage and injured some of our people
today came another rain of
stones and soon after it you appeared among us
by the way said the man with the star looking steadily at the
sorcerer you told us yesterday that there would not be a second rain of stones
yet one has just occurred that was even worse than the first
what is your sorcery good for if it cannot tell us the truth
my sorcery does tell the truth
declared the thorncovered man
i said there would be but one rain of stones
this second one was a rain of peopleandhorseandbuggy
and some stones came with them
will there be any more rains
asked the man with the star
no my prince
neither stones nor people
no my prince
are you sure
quite sure my prince
my sorcery tells me so
just then a man came running into the hall and addressed the prince after making a low bow
more wonders in the air my lord said he
immediately the prince and all of his people flocked out of the hall into the street that they might see what was about to happen
dorothy and zeb jumped out of the buggy and ran after them but the sorcerer remained calmly in his throne
far up in the air was an object that looked like a balloon
it was not so high as the glowing star of the six colored suns but was descending slowly through the airso slowly that at first it scarcely seemed to move
the throng stood still and waited
it was all they could do for to go away and leave that strange sight was impossible nor could they hurry its fall in any way
the earth children were not noticed being so near the average size of the mangaboos and the horse had remained in the
house of the sorcerer with eureka curled up asleep on the seat of the buggy
gradually the balloon grew bigger which was proof that it was settling down upon the land of the mangaboos
dorothy was surprised to find how patient the people were for her own little heart was beating rapidly with excitement
a balloon meant to her some other arrival from the surface of the earth and she hoped it would be some one able to assist her and zeb out of their difficulties
then a little man jumped out of the basket took off his tall hat and bowed very gracefully to the crowd of mangaboos around him
he was quite an old little man and his head was long and entirely bald
why cried dorothy in amazement its oz
the little man looked toward her and seemed as much surprised as she was
but he smiled and bowed as he answered yes my dear i am oz the great and terrible
and you are little
dorothy from kansas
i remember you very well
who did you say it was
whispered zeb to the girl
its the wonderful wizard of oz
havent you heard of him
just then the man with the star came and stood before the wizard
sir said he why are you here in the land of the mangaboos
didnt know what land it was my son returned the other with a pleasant smile and to be honest i didnt mean to visit you when i started out
i live on top of the earth your honor which is far better than living inside it but yesterday i went up in a balloon and when i came down i fell into a big crack in the earth caused by an earthquake
i had let so much gas out of my balloon that i could not rise again and in a few minutes the earth closed over my head
so i continued to descend until i reached this place and if you will show me a way to get out of it ill go with pleasure
sorry to have troubled you but it couldnt be helped
the prince had listened with attention
said he this child who is from the crust of the earth like yourself called you a wizard
is not a wizard something like a sorcerer
its better replied oz promptly
one wizard is worth three
ah you shall prove that said the prince
we mangaboos have at the present time one of the most wonderful sorcerers that ever was picked from a bush but he sometimes makes mistakes
do you ever make mistakes
declared the wizard boldly
said dorothy you made a lot of mistakes when you were in the marvelous land of oz
said the little man turning redalthough just then a ray of violet sunlight was on his round face
come with me said the prince to him
i wish you to meet our
the wizard did not like this invitation but he could not refuse to accept it
so he followed the prince into the great domed hall and
dorothy and zeb came after them while the throng of people trooped in also
there sat the thorny sorcerer in his chair of state and when the wizard saw him he began to laugh uttering comical little chuckles
what an absurd creature
he exclaimed
he may look absurd said the prince in his quiet voice but he is an excellent sorcerer
the only fault i find with him is that he is so often wrong
i am never wrong answered the sorcerer
only a short time ago you told me there would be no more rain of stones or of people said the prince
well what then
here is another person descended from the air to prove you were wrong
one person cannot be called people said the sorcerer
if two should come out of the sky you might with justice say i was wrong but unless more than this one appears i will hold that i was right
very clever said the wizard nodding his head as if pleased
i am delighted to find humbugs inside the earth just the same as on top of it
were you ever with a circus brother
no said the sorcerer
you ought to join one declared the little man seriously
i belong to
bailum barneys great consolidated showsthree rings in one tent and a menagerie on the side
its a fine aggregation i assure you
what do you do
asked the sorcerer
i go up in a balloon usually to draw the crowds to the circus
ive just had the bad luck to come out of the sky skip the solid earth and land lower down than i intended
but never mind
it isnt everybody who gets a chance to see your land of the gabazoos
mangaboos said the sorcerer correcting him
if you are a wizard you ought to be able to call people by their right names
oh im a wizard you may be sure of that
just as good a wizard as you are a sorcerer
that remains to be seen said the other
if you are able to prove that you are better said the prince to the little man i will make you the chief wizard of this domain
otherwise what will happen otherwise
asked the wizard
i will stop you from living and forbid you to be planted returned the prince
that does not sound especially pleasant said the little man looking at the one with the star uneasily
but never mind
ill beat old
prickly all right
my name is gwig said the sorcerer turning his heartless cruel eyes upon his rival
let me see you equal the sorcery i am about to perform
he waved a thorny hand and at once the tinkling of bells was heard playing sweet music
yet look where she would dorothy could discover no bells at all in the great glass hall
the mangaboo people listened but showed no great interest
it was one of the things gwig usually did to prove he was a sorcerer
now was the wizards turn so he smiled upon the assemblage and asked will somebody kindly loan me a hat
no one did because the mangaboos did not wear hats and zeb had lost his somehow in his flight through the air
said the wizard will somebody please loan me a handkerchief
but they had no handkerchiefs either
very good remarked the wizard
ill use my own hat if you please
now good people observe me carefully
you see there is nothing up my sleeve and nothing concealed about my person
also my hat is quite empty
he took off his hat and held it upside down shaking it briskly
let me see it said the sorcerer
he took the hat and examined it carefully returning it afterward to the
now said the little man i will create something out of nothing
the people watched it intently for they had never seen a pig before big or little
he placed one upon the floor so that it could run around and pulled apart the other making three piglets in all and then one of these was pulled apart making four piglets
the wizard continued this surprising performance until nine tiny piglets were running about at his feet all squealing and grunting in a very comical way
now said the wizard of oz having created something from nothing i will make something nothing again
with this he caught up two of the piglets and pushed them together so that the two were one
then he caught up another piglet and pushed it into the first where it disappeared
and so one by one the nine tiny piglets were pushed together until but a single one of the creatures remained
this the wizard placed underneath his hat and made a mystic sign above it
when he removed his hat the last piglet had disappeared entirely
he will not be a wonderful wizard long remarked gwig
enquired the wizard
because i am going to stop your breath was the reply
i perceive that you are curiously constructed and that if you cannot breathe you cannot keep alive
the little man looked troubled
how long will it take you to stop my breath
about five minutes
im going to begin now
watch me carefully
he began making queer signs and passes toward the wizard but the little man did not watch him long
instead he drew a leathern case from his pocket and took from it several sharp knives which he joined together one after another until they made a long sword
by the time he had attached a handle to this sword he was having much trouble to breathe as the charm of the sorcerer was beginning to take effect
so the wizard lost no more time but leaping forward he raised the sharp sword whirled it once or twice around his head and then gave a mighty stroke that cut the body of the sorcerer exactly in two
why hes vegetable
cried the wizard astonished
of course said the prince
we are all vegetable in this country
are you not vegetable also
no answered the wizard
people on top of the earth are all meat
will your sorcerer die
certainly sir
he is really dead now and will wither very quickly
so we must plant him at once that other sorcerers may grow upon his bush continued the prince
what do you mean by that
asked the little wizard greatly puzzled
if you will accompany me to our public gardens replied the prince i will explain to you much better than i can here the mysteries of our
vegetable kingdom
illustration the wizard cut the sorcerer exactly in two
the vegetable kingdom
sorcerer to the public gardens
the seat was amply wide enough for the little man and the two children and when jim started to leave the hall the kitten jumped upon his back and sat there quite contentedly
there were paths through these gardens and over some of the brooks were ornamental glass bridges
dorothy and zeb now got out of the buggy and walked beside the prince so that they might see and examine the flowers and plants better
who built these lovely bridges
asked the little girl
no one built them answered the man with the star
thats queer said she
did the glass houses in your city grow too
of course he replied
but it took a good many years for them to grow as large and fine as they are now
that is why we are so angry when a
rain of stones comes to break our towers and crack our roofs
cant you mend them
she enquired
no but they will grow together again in time and we must wait until they do
a flower would be pink one second white the next then blue or yellow and it was the same way when they came to the plants which had broad leaves and grew close to the ground
when they passed over a field of grass jim immediately stretched down his head and began to nibble
a nice country this is he grumbled where a respectable horse has to eat pink grass
its violet said the wizard who was in the buggy
now its blue complained the horse
as a matter of fact im eating rainbow grass
how does it taste
asked the wizard
not bad at all said jim
if they give me plenty of it ill not complain about its color
by this time the party had reached a freshly plowed field and the
prince said to dorothy this is our plantingground
several mangaboos came forward with glass spades and dug a hole in the ground
then they put the two halves of the sorcerer into it and covered him up
after that other people brought water from a brook and sprinkled the earth
he will sprout very soon said the prince and grow into a large bush from which we shall in time be able to pick several very good sorcerers
do all your people grow on bushes
asked the boy
certainly was the reply
do not all people grow upon bushes where you came from on the outside of the earth
not that i ever heard of
how strange
but if you will come with me to one of our folk gardens i will show you the way we grow in the land of the mangaboos
it appeared that these odd people while they were able to walk through the air with ease usually moved upon the ground in the ordinary way
there were no stairs in their houses because they did not need them but on a level surface they generally walked just as we do
the little party of strangers now followed the prince across a few more of the glass bridges and along several paths until they came to a garden enclosed by a high hedge
jim had refused to leave the field of grass where he was engaged in busily eating so the wizard got out of the buggy and joined zeb and dorothy and the kitten followed demurely at their heels
inside the hedge they came upon row after row of large and handsome plants with broad leaves gracefully curving until their points nearly reached the ground
in the center of each plant grew a daintily dressed
mangaboo for the clothing of all these creatures grew upon them and was attached to their bodies
the growing mangaboos were of all sizes from the blossom that had just turned into a wee baby to the fullgrown and almost ripe man or woman
on some of the bushes might be seen a bud a blossom a baby a halfgrown person and a ripe one but even those ready to pluck were motionless and silent as if devoid of life
this sight explained to
dorothy why she had seen no children among the mangaboos a thing she had until now been unable to account for
our people do not acquire their real life until they leave their bushes said the prince
you will notice they are all attached to the plants by the soles of their feet and when they are quite ripe they are easily separated from the stems and at once attain the powers of motion and speech
so while they grow they cannot be said to really live and they must be picked before they can become good citizens
how long do you live after you are picked
asked dorothy
that depends upon the care we take of ourselves he replied
if we keep cool and moist and meet with no accidents we often live for five years
ive been picked over six years but our family is known to be especially long lived
do you eat
asked the boy
we are quite solid inside our bodies and have no need to eat any more than does a potato
but the potatoes sometimes sprout said zeb
and sometimes we do answered the prince but that is considered a great misfortune for then we must be planted at once
where did you grow
asked the wizard
i will show you was the reply
step this way please
he led them within another but smaller circle of hedge where grew one large and beautiful bush
this said he is the royal bush of the mangaboos
all of our princes and rulers have grown upon this one bush from time immemorial
they stood before it in silent admiration
the maidens gown was soft as satin and fell about her in ample folds while dainty lacelike traceries trimmed the bodice and sleeves
her flesh was fine and smooth as polished ivory and her poise expressed both dignity and grace
who is this
asked the wizard curiously
the prince had been staring hard at the girl on the bush
now he answered with a touch of uneasiness in his cold tones she is the ruler destined to be my successor for she is a royal
when she becomes fully ripe i must abandon the sovereignty of the mangaboos to her
isnt she ripe now
asked dorothy
he hesitated
not quite said he finally
it will be several days before she needs to be picked or at least that is my judgment
i am in no hurry to resign my office and be planted you may be sure
probably not declared the wizard nodding
im sure the princess is ready to be picked asserted dorothy gazing hard at the beautiful girl on the bush
shes as perfect as she can be
what are you going to do with us
that is a matter i have not quite decided upon was the reply
i think i shall keep this wizard until a new sorcerer is ready to pick for he seems quite skillful and may be of use to us
but the rest of you must be destroyed in some way and you cannot be planted because i do not wish horses and cats and meat people growing all over our country
you neednt worry said dorothy
we wouldnt grow under ground im sure
but why destroy my friends
asked the little wizard
why not let them live
they do not belong here returned the prince
they have no right to be inside the earth at all
we didnt ask to come down here we fell said dorothy
that is no excuse declared the prince coldly
the children looked at each other in perplexity and the wizard sighed
eureka rubbed her paw on her face and said in her soft purring voice he wont need to destroy me for if i dont get something to eat pretty soon i shall starve to death and so save him the trouble
if he planted you he might grow some cattails suggested the wizard
perhaps we can find you some milkweeds to eat said the boy
snarled the kitten i wouldnt touch the nasty things
you dont need milk eureka remarked dorothy you are big enough now to eat any kind of food
if i can get it added eureka
im hungry myself said zeb
but i noticed some strawberries growing in one of the gardens and some melons in another place
these people dont eat such things so perhaps on our way back they will let us get them
never mind your hunger interrupted the prince
i shall order you destroyed in a few minutes so you will have no need to ruin our pretty melon vines and berry bushes
follow me please to meet your doom
dorothy picks the princess
the words of the cold and moist vegetable prince were not very comforting and as he spoke them he turned away and left the enclosure
the children feeling sad and despondent were about to follow him when the wizard touched dorothy softly on her shoulder
he whispered
asked the girl
suppose we pick the royal princess said the wizard
im quite sure shes ripe and as soon as she comes to life she will be the ruler and may treat us better than that heartless prince intends to
exclaimed dorothy eagerly
lets pick her while we have the chance before the man with the star comes back
so together they leaned over the great bush and each of them seized one hand of the lovely princess
cried dorothy and as they did so the royal lady leaned toward them and the stems snapped and separated from her feet
she was not at all heavy so the wizard and dorothy managed to lift her gently to the ground
we salute your royal highness
cried the wizard kneeling and kissing her hand
just then the voice of the prince was heard calling upon them to hasten and a moment later he returned to the enclosure followed by a number of his people
instantly the princess turned and faced him and when he saw that she was picked the prince stood still and began to tremble
sir said the royal lady with much dignity you have wronged me greatly and would have wronged me still more had not these strangers come to my rescue
i have been ready for picking all the past week but because you were selfish and desired to continue your unlawful rule you left me to stand silent upon my bush
i did not know that you were ripe answered the prince in a low voice
give me the star of royalty
she commanded
slowly he took the shining star from his own brow and placed it upon that of the princess
then all the people bowed low to her and the
prince turned and walked away alone
what became of him afterward our friends never knew
the people of mangaboo now formed themselves into a procession and marched toward the glass city to escort their new ruler to her palace and to perform those ceremonies proper to the occasion
but while the people in the procession walked upon the ground the princess walked in the air just above their heads to show that she was a superior being and more exalted than her subjects
no one now seemed to pay any attention to the strangers so dorothy and
zeb and the wizard let the train pass on and then wandered by themselves into the vegetable gardens
they did not bother to cross the bridges over the brooks but when they came to a stream they stepped high and walked in the air to the other side
this was a very interesting experience to them and dorothy said i wonder why it is that we can walk so easily in the air
perhaps answered the wizard it is because we are close to the center of the earth where the attraction of gravitation is very slight
but ive noticed that many queer things happen in fairy countries
is this a fairy country
asked the boy
of course it is returned dorothy promptly
only a fairy country could have vegtable people and only in a fairy country could eureka and jim talk as we do
thats true said zeb thoughtfully
in the vegetable gardens they found the strawberries and melons and several other unknown but delicious fruits of which they ate heartily
but the kitten bothered them constantly by demanding milk or meat and called the wizard names because he could not bring her a dish of milk by means of his magical arts
as they sat upon the grass watching jim who was still busily eating
eureka said i dont believe you are a wizard at all
no answered the little man you are quite right
in the strict sense of the word i am not a wizard but only a humbug
the wizard of oz has always been a humbug agreed dorothy
ive known him for a long time
if that is so said the boy how could he do that wonderful trick with the nine tiny piglets
dont know said dorothy but it must have been humbug
very true declared the wizard nodding at her
it was necessary to deceive that ugly sorcerer and the prince as well as their stupid people but i dont mind telling you who are my friends that the thing was only a trick
but i saw the little pigs with my own eyes
exclaimed zeb
so did i purred the kitten
to be sure answered the wizard
you saw them because they were there
they are in my inside pocket now
but the pulling of them apart and pushing them together again was only a sleightofhand trick
lets see the pigs said eureka eagerly
the little man felt carefully in his pocket and pulled out the tiny piglets setting them upon the grass one by one where they ran around and nibbled the tender blades
theyre hungry too he said
oh what cunning things
cried dorothy catching up one and petting it
be careful
said the piglet with a squeal youre squeezing me
murmured the wizard looking at his pets in astonishment
they can actually talk
may i eat one of them
asked the kitten in a pleading voice
im awfully hungry
why eureka said dorothy reproachfully what a cruel question
it would be dreadful to eat these dear little things
i should say so
grunted another of the piglets looking uneasily at the kitten cats are cruel things
im not cruel replied the kitten yawning
im just hungry
you cannot eat my piglets even if you are starving declared the little man in a stern voice
they are the only things i have to prove
im a wizard
how did they happen to be so little
asked dorothy
i never saw such small pigs before
they are from the island of teentyweent said the wizard where everything is small because its a small island
a sailor brought them to los angeles and i gave him nine tickets to the circus for them
but what am i going to eat
wailed the kitten sitting in front of
dorothy and looking pleadingly into her face
there are no cows here to give milk or any mice or even grasshoppers
and if i cant eat the piglets you may as well plant me at once and raise catsup
i have an idea said the wizard that there are fishes in these brooks
do you like fish
cried the kitten
do i like fish
why theyre better than pigletsor even milk
then ill try to catch you some said he
but wont they be vegtable like everything else here
asked the kitten
i think not
fishes are not animals and they are as cold and moist as the vegetables themselves
there is no reason that i can see why they may not exist in the waters of this strange country
then the wizard bent a pin for a hook and took a long piece of string from his pocket for a fishline
the only bait he could find was a bright red blossom from a flower but he knew fishes are easy to fool if anything bright attracts their attention so he decided to try the blossom
illustration in the garden of the mangaboos
cried dorothy did you eat the bones
if it had any bones i ate them replied the kitten composedly as it washed its face after the meal
but i dont think that fish had any bones because i didnt feel them scratch my throat
you were very greedy said the girl
i was very hungry replied the kitten
the little pigs had stood huddled in a group watching this scene with frightened eyes
cats are dreadful creatures
said one of them
im glad we are not fishes
said another
dont worry dorothy murmured soothingly ill not let the kitten hurt you
then she happened to remember that in a corner of her suitcase were one or two crackers that were left over from her luncheon on the train and she went to the buggy and brought them
eureka stuck up her nose at such food but the tiny piglets squealed delightedly at the sight of the crackers and ate them up in a jiffy
now let us go back to the city suggested the wizard
that is if jim has had enough of the pink grass
the cabhorse who was browsing near lifted his head with a sigh
ive tried to eat a lot while i had the chance said he for its likely to be a long while between meals in this strange country
but im ready to go now at any time you wish
so after the wizard had put the piglets back into his inside pocket where they cuddled up and went to sleep the three climbed into the buggy and jim started back to the town
where shall we stay
asked the girl
they agreed to this plan and when they reached the great square jim drew the buggy into the big door of the domed hall
it doesnt look very homelike said dorothy gazing around at the bare room
but its a place to stay anyhow
what are those holes up there
enquired the boy pointing to some openings that appeared near the top of the dome
they look like doorways said dorothy only there are no stairs to get to them
you forget that stairs are unnecessary observed the wizard
let us walk up and see where the doors lead to
with this he began walking in the air toward the high openings and
dorothy and zeb followed him
following these halls they discovered many small rooms opening from them and some were furnished with glass benches tables and chairs
but there were no beds at all
i wonder if these people never sleep said the girl
why there seems to be no night at all in this country zeb replied
those colored suns are exactly in the same place they were when we came and if there is no sunset there can be no night
very true agreed the wizard
but it is a long time since i have had any sleep and im tired
so i think i shall lie down upon one of these hard glass benches and take a nap
i will too said dorothy and chose a little room at the end of the hall
zeb walked down again to unharness jim who when he found himself free rolled over a few times and then settled down to sleep with eureka nestling comfortably beside his big boney body
then the boy returned to one of the upper rooms and in spite of the hardness of the glass bench was soon deep in slumberland
illustration
the mangaboos prove dangerous
when the wizard awoke the six colored suns were shining down upon the
land of the mangaboos just as they had done ever since his arrival
the little man having had a good sleep felt rested and refreshed and looking through the glass partition of the room he saw zeb sitting up on his bench and yawning
so the wizard went in to him
zeb said he my balloon is of no further use in this strange country so i may as well leave it on the square where it fell
but in the basketcar are some things i would like to keep with me
i wish you would go and fetch my satchel two lanterns and a can of kerosene oil that is under the seat
there is nothing else that i care about
so the boy went willingly upon the errand and by the time he had returned dorothy was awake
then the three held a counsel to decide what they should do next but could think of no way to better their condition
i dont like these vegtable people said the little girl
theyre cold and flabby like cabbages in spite of their prettiness
i agree with you
it is because there is no warm blood in them remarked the wizard
and they have no hearts so they cant love anyonenot even themselves declared the boy
the princess is lovely to look at continued dorothy thoughtfully but i dont care much for her after all
if there was any other place to go id like to go there
but is there any other place
asked the wizard
i dont know she answered
how can we go away
asked dorothy
oh you cannot go away of course so you must be destroyed was the answer
in what way
enquired the wizard
we shall throw you three people into the garden of the twining vines said the princess and they will soon crush you and devour your bodies to make themselves grow bigger
the animals you have with you we will drive to the mountains and put into the black pit
then our country will be rid of all its unwelcome visitors
but you are in need of a sorcerer said the wizard and not one of those growing is yet ripe enough to pick
i am greater than any thorncovered sorcerer that ever grew in your garden
why destroy me
let us see your arts and the sorceries you are able to perform
then i will decide whether to destroy you with the others or not
at this the wizard made a bow to the people and repeated his trick of producing the nine tiny piglets and making them disappear again
he did it very cleverly indeed and the princess looked at the strange piglets as if she were as truly astonished as any vegetable person could be
but afterward she said i have heard of this wonderful magic
but it accomplishes nothing of value
what else can you do
the wizard tried to think
then he jointed together the blades of his sword and balanced it very skillfully upon the end of his nose
but even that did not satisfy the princess
just then his eye fell upon the lanterns and the can of kerosene oil which zeb had brought from the car of his balloon and he got a clever idea from those commonplace things
your highness said he i will now proceed to prove my magic by creating two suns that you have never seen before also i will exhibit a
destroyer much more dreadful than your clinging vines
so he placed dorothy upon one side of him and the boy upon the other and set a lantern upon each of their heads
dont laugh he whispered to them or you will spoil the effect of my magic
illustration now princess exclaimed the wizard
then with much dignity and a look of vast importance upon his wrinkled face the wizard got out his matchbox and lighted the two lanterns
the glare they made was very small when compared with the radiance of the six great colored suns but still they gleamed steadily and clearly
mangaboos were much impressed because they had never before seen any light that did not come directly from their suns
next the wizard poured a pool of oil from the can upon the glass floor where it covered quite a broad surface
when he lighted the oil a hundred tongues of flame shot up and the effect was really imposing
now princess exclaimed the wizard those of your advisors who wished to throw us into the garden of clinging vines must step within this circle of light
if they advised you well and were in the right they will not be injured in any way
but if any advised you wrongly the light will wither him
some of the mangaboos fell down and had to be dragged from the fire and all were so withered that it would be necessary to plant them at once
sir said the princess to the wizard you are greater than any
sorcerer we have ever known
as it is evident that my people have advised me wrongly i will not cast you three people into the dreadful
garden of the clinging vines but your animals must be driven into the
black pit in the mountain for my subjects cannot bear to have them around
for two or three days after thisif we call days the periods between sleep there being no night to divide the hours into daysour friends were not disturbed in any way
they were even permitted to occupy the
house of the sorcerer in peace as if it had been their own and to wander in the gardens in search of food
once they came near to the enclosed garden of the clinging vines and walking high into the air looked down upon it with much interest
they saw a mass of tough green vines all matted together and writhing and twisting around like a nest of great snakes
everything the vines touched they crushed and our adventurers were indeed thankful to have escaped being cast among them
they knew the kitten by this time so they scampered over to where she lay beside jim and commenced to frisk and play with her
the cabhorse who never slept long at a time sat upon his haunches and watched the tiny piglets and the kitten with much approval
dont be rough
he would call out if eureka knocked over one of the round fat piglets with her paw but the pigs never minded and enjoyed the sport very greatly
suddenly they looked up to find the room filled with the silent solemneyed mangaboos
each of the vegetable folks bore a branch covered with sharp thorns which was thrust defiantly toward the horse the kitten and the piglets
herestop this foolishness
jim roared angrily but after being pricked once or twice he got upon his four legs and kept out of the way of the thorns
the mangaboos surrounded them in solid ranks but left an opening to the doorway of the hall so the animals slowly retreated until they were driven from the room and out upon the street
here were more of the vegetable people with thorns and silently they urged the now frightened creatures down the street
jim had to be careful not to step upon the tiny piglets who scampered under his feet grunting and squealing while
eureka snarling and biting at the thorns pushed toward her also tried to protect the pretty little things from injury
slowly but steadily the heartless mangaboos drove them on until they had passed through the city and the gardens and come to the broad plains leading to the mountain
what does all this mean anyhow
asked the horse jumping to escape a thorn
why they are driving us toward the black pit into which they threatened to cast us replied the kitten
if i were as big as you are jim id fight these miserable turniproots
what would you do
enquired jim
id kick out with those long legs and ironshod hoofs
all right said the horse ill do it
an instant later he suddenly backed toward the crowd of mangaboos and kicked out his hind legs as hard as he could
but the foes were too many to be repulsed for long
they tired jim and
eureka out and although the field of battle was thickly covered with mashed and disabled mangaboos our animal friends had to give up at last and allow themselves to be driven to the mountain
illustration
into the black pit and out again
when they came to the mountain it proved to be a rugged towering chunk of deep green glass and looked dismal and forbidding in the extreme
half way up the steep was a yawning cave black as night beyond the point where the rainbow rays of the colored suns reached into it
this is dreadful
groaned jim
it will be about the end of our adventures i guess
if the wizard was here said one of the piglets sobbing bitterly he would not see us suffer so
we ought to have called him and dorothy when we were first attacked added eureka
but never mind be brave my friends and i will go and tell our masters where you are and get them to come to your rescue
the mouth of the hole was nearly filled up now but the kitten gave a leap through the remaining opening and at once scampered up into the air
the mangaboos saw her escape and several of them caught up their thorns and gave chase mounting through the air after her
eureka however was lighter than the mangaboos and while they could mount only about a hundred feet above the earth the kitten found she could go nearly two hundred feet
so she ran along over their heads until she had left them far behind and below and had come to the city and the house of the sorcerer
there she entered in at dorothys window in the dome and aroused her from her sleep
as soon as the little girl knew what had happened she awakened the
wizard and zeb and at once preparations were made to go to the rescue of jim and the piglets
the wizard carried his satchel which was quite heavy and zeb carried the two lanterns and the oil can
dorothys wicker suitcase was still under the seat of the buggy and by good fortune the boy had also placed the harness in the buggy when he had taken it off from jim to let the horse lie down and rest
so there was nothing for the girl to carry but the kitten which she held close to her bosom and tried to comfort for its little heart was still beating rapidly
before long they neared the black pit where a busy swarm of mangaboos headed by their princess was engaged in piling up glass rocks before the entrance
stop i command you
cried the wizard in an angry tone and at once began pulling down the rocks to liberate jim and the piglets
instead of opposing him in this they stood back in silence until he had made a goodsized hole in the barrier when by order of the princess they all sprang forward and thrust out their sharp thorns
illustration through the black pit
dorothy hopped inside the opening to escape being pricked and zeb and the wizard after enduring a few stabs from the thorns were glad to follow her
at once the mangaboos began piling up the rocks of glass again and as the little man realized that they were all about to be entombed in the mountain he said to the children my dears what shall we do
jump out and fight
whats the use
replied dorothy
id as soon die here as live much longer among those cruel and heartless people
thats the way i feel about it remarked zeb rubbing his wounds
ive had enough of the mangaboos
all right said the wizard im with you whatever you decide
but we cant live long in this cavern thats certain
noticing that the light was growing dim he picked up his nine piglets patted each one lovingly on its fat little head and placed them carefully in his inside pocket
zeb struck a match and lighted one of the lanterns
the rays of the colored suns were now shut out from them forever for the last chinks had been filled up in the wall that separated their prison from the land of the mangaboos
how big is this hole
asked dorothy
ill explore it and see replied the boy
so he carried the lantern back for quite a distance while dorothy and the wizard followed at his side
it isnt a bad road observed the wizard and if we followed it it might lead us to some place that is more comfortable than this black pocket we are now in
the others agreed readily to this sensible suggestion and at once the boy began to harness jim to the buggy
jim stopped sometimes to rest for the climb was rather steep and tiresome
we must be nearly as high as the six colored suns by this time said
i didnt know this mountain was so tall
we are certainly a good distance away from the land of the mangaboos added zeb for we have slanted away from it ever since we started
but they kept steadily moving and just as jim was about tired out with his long journey the way suddenly grew lighter and zeb put out the lanterns to save the oil
to their joy they found it was a white light that now greeted them for all were weary of the colored rainbow lights which after a time had made their eyes ache with their constantly shifting rays
the sides of the tunnel showed before them like the inside of a long spyglass and the floor became more level
illustration
the valley of voices
it was all laid out into lovely lawns and gardens with pebble paths leading through them and groves of beautiful and stately trees dotting the landscape here and there
there were orchards too bearing luscious fruits that are all unknown in our world
none of them were in clusters such as villages or towns but each had ample grounds of its own with orchards and gardens surrounding it
several minutes were consumed in silent admiration before they noticed two very singular and unusual facts about this valley
one was that it was lighted from some unseen source for no sun or moon was in the arched blue sky although every object was flooded with a clear and perfect light
the second and even more singular fact was the absence of any inhabitant of this splendid place
from their elevated position they could overlook the entire valley but not a single moving object could they see
all appeared mysteriously deserted
the mountain on this side was not glass but made of a stone similar to granite
with some difficulty and danger jim drew the buggy over the loose rocks until he reached the green lawns below where the paths and orchards and gardens began
the nearest cottage was still some distance away
isnt it fine
cried dorothy in a joyous voice as she sprang out of the buggy and let eureka run frolicking over the velvety grass
yes indeed
answered zeb
we were lucky to get away from those dreadful vegetable people
it wouldnt be so bad remarked the wizard gazing around him if we were obliged to live here always
we couldnt find a prettier place im sure
he took the piglets from his pocket and let them run on the grass and
jim tasted a mouthful of the green blades and declared he was very contented in his new surroundings
we cant walk in the air here though called eureka who had tried it and failed but the others were satisfied to walk on the ground and the
wizard said they must be nearer the surface of the earth than they had been in the mangaboo country for everything was more homelike and natural
but where are the people
asked dorothy
the little man shook his bald head
cant imagine my dear he replied
they heard the sudden twittering of a bird but could not find the creature anywhere
slowly they walked along the path toward the nearest cottage the piglets racing and gambolling beside them and jim pausing at every step for another mouthful of grass
presently they came to a low plant which had broad spreading leaves in the center of which grew a single fruit about as large as a peach
the fruit was so daintily colored and so fragrant and looked so appetizing and delicious that dorothy stopped and exclaimed what is it do you spose
the piglets had smelled the fruit quickly and before the girl could reach out her hand to pluck it every one of the nine tiny ones had rushed in and commenced to devour it with great eagerness
its good anyway said zeb or those little rascals wouldnt have gobbled it up so greedily
where are they
asked dorothy in astonishment
they all looked around but the piglets had disappeared
cried the wizard they must have run away
but i didnt see them go did you
replied the boy and the girl together
herepiggy piggy piggy
called their master anxiously
several squeals and grunts were instantly heard at his feet but the
wizard could not discover a single piglet
where are you
why right beside you spoke a tiny voice
cant you see us
illustration are there really people in this room
no answered the little man in a puzzled tone
we can see you said another of the piglets
the wizard stooped down and put out his hand and at once felt the small fat body of one of his pets
he picked it up but could not see what he held
it is very strange said he soberly
the piglets have become invisible in some curious way
ill bet its because they ate that peach
cried the kitten
it wasnt a peach eureka said dorothy
i only hope it wasnt poison
it was fine dorothy called one of the piglets
well eat all we can find of them said another
but we musnt eat them the wizard warned the children or we too may become invisible and lose each other
if we come across another of the strange fruit we must avoid it
the travellers now resumed their walk toward the cottage which they presently reached
it was a pretty place with vines growing thickly over the broad front porch
the door stood open and a table was set in the front room with four chairs drawn up to it
on the table were plates knives and forks and dishes of bread meat and fruits
the meat was smoking hot and the knives and forks were performing strange antics and jumping here and there in quite a puzzling way
but not a single person appeared to be in the room
exclaimed dorothy who with zeb and the wizard now stood in the doorway
a peal of merry laughter answered her and the knives and forks fell to the plates with a clatter
one of the chairs pushed back from the table and this was so astonishing and mysterious that dorothy was almost tempted to run away in fright
here are strangers mama
cried the shrill and childish voice of some unseen person
so i see my dear answered another voice soft and womanly
what do you want
demanded a third voice in a stern gruff accent
said the wizard are there really people in this room
of course replied the mans voice
andpardon me for the foolish questionbut are you all invisible
surely the woman answered repeating her low rippling laughter
are you surprised that you are unable to see the people of voe
why yes stammered the wizard
all the people i have ever met before were very plain to see
where do you come from then
asked the woman in a curious tone
we belong upon the face of the earth explained the wizard but recently during an earthquake we fell down a crack and landed in the
country of the mangaboos
dreadful creatures
exclaimed the womans voice
ive heard of them
they walled us up in a mountain continued the wizard but we found there was a tunnel through to this side so we came here
it is a beautiful place
what do you call it
it is the valley of voe
we have seen no people since we arrived so we came to this house to enquire our way
are you hungry
asked the womans voice
i could eat something said dorothy
so could i added zeb
but we do not wish to intrude i assure you the wizard hastened to say
thats all right returned the mans voice more pleasantly than before
you are welcome to what we have
as he spoke the voice came so near to zeb that he jumped back in alarm
two childish voices laughed merrily at this action and dorothy was sure they were in no danger among such lighthearted folks even if those folks couldnt be seen
what curious animal is that which is eating the grass on my lawn
enquired the mans voice
thats jim said the girl
hes a horse
what is he good for
was the next question
he draws the buggy you see fastened to him and we ride in the buggy instead of walking she explained
can he fight
asked the mans voice
he can kick pretty hard with his heels and bite a little but jim cant zactly fight she replied
then the bears will get him said one of the childrens voices
exclaimed dorothy
are these bears here
that is the one evil of our country answered the invisible man
many large and fierce bears roam in the valley of voe and when they can catch any of us they eat us up but as they cannot see us we seldom get caught
are the bears invisble too
asked the girl
yes for they eat of the damafruit as we all do and that keeps them from being seen by any eye whether human or animal
does the damafruit grow on a low bush and look something like a peach
asked the wizard
yes was the reply
if it makes you invisble why do you eat it
dorothy enquired
for two reasons my dear the womans voice answered
the damafruit is the most delicious thing that grows and when it makes us invisible the bears cannot find us to eat us up
but now good wanderers your luncheon is on the table so please sit down and eat as much as you like
illustration
they fight the invisible bears
the strangers took their seats at the table willingly enough for they were all hungry and the platters were now heaped with good things to eat
but dorothy satisfied her hunger with other things and her companions did likewise resisting the temptation
why do you not eat the damas
asked the womans voice
we dont want to get invisble answered the girl
but if you remain visible the bears will see you and devour you said a girlish young voice that belonged to one of the children
we who live here much prefer to be invisible for we can still hug and kiss one another and are quite safe from the bears
and we do not have to be so particular about our dress remarked the man
and mama cant tell whether my face is dirty or not
added the other childish voice gleefully
but i make you wash it every time i think of it said the mother for it stands to reason your face is dirty ianu whether i can see it or not
dorothy laughed and stretched out her hands
come here pleaseianu and your sisterand let me feel of you she requested
they came to her willingly and dorothy passed her hands over their faces and forms and decided one was a girl of about her own age and the other a boy somewhat smaller
the girls hair was soft and fluffy and her skin as smooth as satin
when dorothy gently touched her nose and ears and lips they seemed to be well and delicately formed
if i could see you i am sure you would be beautiful she declared
the girl laughed and her mother said we are not vain in the valley of voe because we can not display our beauty and good actions and pleasant ways are what make us lovely to our companions
yet we can see and appreciate the beauties of nature the dainty flowers and trees the green fields and the clear blue of the sky
how about the birds and beasts and fishes
the birds we cannot see because they love to eat of the damas as much as we do yet we hear their sweet songs and enjoy them
neither can we see the cruel bears for they also eat the fruit
but the fishes that swim in our brooks we can see and often we catch them to eat
it occurs to me you have a great deal to make you happy even while invisible remarked the wizard
nevertheless we prefer to remain visible while we are in your valley
just then eureka came in for she had been until now wandering outside with jim and when the kitten saw the table set with food she cried out now you must feed me dorothy for im half starved
then as the others had by this time moved away from the table the kitten sprang upon the chair and put her paws upon the cloth to see what there was to eat
to her surprise an unseen hand clutched her and held her suspended in the air
eureka was frantic with terror and tried to scratch and bite so the next moment she was dropped to the floor
did you see that dorothy
she gasped
yes dear her mistress replied there are people living in this house although we cannot see them
and you must have better manners
eureka or something worse will happen to you
she placed a plate of food upon the floor and the kitten ate greedily
give me that nicesmelling fruit i saw on the table she begged when she had cleaned the plate
those are damas said dorothy and you must never even taste them
eureka or youll get invisble and then we cant see you at all
the kitten gazed wistfully at the forbidden fruit
does it hurt to be invisble
i dont know dorothy answered but it would hurt me drefully to lose you
very well i wont touch it decided the kitten but you must keep it away from me for the smell is very tempting
can you tell us sir or maam said the wizard addressing the air because he did not quite know where the unseen people stood if there is any way we can get out of your beautiful valley and on top of the
earth again
oh one can leave the valley easily enough answered the mans voice but to do so you must enter a far less pleasant country
as for reaching the top of the earth i have never heard that it is possible to do that and if you succeeded in getting there you would probably fall off
oh no said dorothy weve been there and we know
the valley of voe is certainly a charming place resumed the wizard but we cannot be contented in any other land than our own for long
even if we should come to unpleasant places on our way it is necessary in order to reach the earths surface to keep moving on toward it
in that case said the man it will be best for you to cross our
valley and mount the spiral staircase inside the pyramid mountain
the top of that mountain is lost in the clouds and when you reach it you will be in the awful land of naught where the gargoyles live
what are gargoyles
i do not know young sir
the wanderers were rather discouraged by this gloomy report but dorothy said with a sigh if the only way to get home is to meet the gurgles then weve got to meet em
they cant be worse than the wicked witch or the nome king
but you must remember you had the scarecrow and the tin woodman to help you conquer those enemies suggested the wizard
just now my dear there is not a single warrior in your company
oh i guess zeb could fight if he had to
couldnt you zeb
asked the little girl
perhaps if i had to answered zeb doubtfully
and you have the jointed sword that you chopped the vegtable sorcerer in two with the girl said to the little man
true he replied and in my satchel are other useful things to fight with
what the gargoyles most dread is a noise said the mans voice
champion told me that when he shouted his battlecry the creatures shuddered and drew back hesitating to continue the combat
but they were in great numbers and the champion could not shout much because he had to save his breath for fighting
very good said the wizard we can all yell better than we can fight so we ought to defeat the gargoyles
but tell me said dorothy how did such a brave champion happen to let the bears eat him
and if he was invisble and the bears invisble who knows that they really ate him up
they followed the course of a broad stream and passed several more pretty cottages but of course they saw no one nor did any one speak to them
fruits and flowers grew plentifully all about and there were many of the delicious damas that the people of voe were so fond of
be careful
the wizard got out his sword at once and zeb grabbed the horsewhip
dorothy climbed into the buggy although jim had been unharnessed from it and was grazing some distance away
the owner of the unseen voice laughed lightly and said you cannot escape the bears that way
how can we scape
asked dorothy nervously for an unseen danger is always the hardest to face
you must take to the river was the reply
the bears will not venture upon the water
but we would be drowned
exclaimed the girl
oh there is no need of that said the voice which from its gentle tones seemed to belong to a young girl
you are strangers in the valley of voe and do not seem to know our ways so i will try to save you
the next moment a broadleaved plant was jerked from the ground where it grew and held suspended in the air before the wizard
illustration escaping the invisible bears
sir said the voice you must rub these leaves upon the soles of all your feet and then you will be able to walk upon the water without sinking below the surface
it is a secret the bears do not know and we people of voe usually walk upon the water when we travel and so escape our enemies
cried the wizard joyfully and at once rubbed a leaf upon the soles of dorothys shoes and then upon his own
he had nearly finished this last task when a low growling was suddenly heard and the horse began to jump around and kick viciously with his heels
to the water or you are lost
cried their unseen friend and without hesitation the wizard drew the buggy down the bank and out upon the broad river for dorothy was still seated in it with eureka in her arms
they did not sink at all owing to the virtues of the strange plant they had used and when the buggy was in the middle of the stream the wizard returned to the bank to assist zeb and jim
the horse was plunging madly about and two or three deep gashes appeared upon its flanks from which the blood flowed freely
run for the river
shouted the wizard and jim quickly freed himself from his unseen tormenters by a few vicious kicks and then obeyed
as soon as he trotted out upon the surface of the river he found himself safe from pursuit and zeb was already running across the water toward
as the little wizard turned to follow them he felt a hot breath against his cheek and heard a low fierce growl
at once he began stabbing at the air with his sword and he knew that he had struck some substance because when he drew back the blade it was dripping with blood
on the river however the adventurers seemed to be perfectly safe
dorothy and the buggy had floated slowly down stream with the current of the water and the others made haste to join her
the wizard opened his satchel and got out some stickingplaster with which he mended the cuts
jim had received from the claws of the bears
i think wed better stick to the river after this said dorothy
if our unknown friend hadnt warned us and told us what to do we would all be dead by this time
that is true agreed the wizard and as the river seems to be flowing in the direction of the pyramid mountain it will be the easiest way for us to travel
zeb hitched jim to the buggy again and the horse trotted along and drew them rapidly over the smooth water
the kitten was at first dreadfully afraid of getting wet but dorothy let her down and soon eureka was frisking along beside the buggy without being scared a bit
after a journey of several hours they came to a point where the river curved and they found they must cross a mile or so of the valley before they came to the pyramid mountain
there were few houses in this part and few orchards or flowers so our friends feared they might encounter more of the savage bears which they had learned to dread with all their hearts
youll have to make a dash jim said the wizard and run as fast as you can go
all right answered the horse ill do my best
but you must remember
im old and my dashing days are past and gone
all three got into the buggy and zeb picked up the reins though jim needed no guidance of any sort
then zeb in a spirit of mischief uttered a growl like that of the bears and jim pricked up his ears and fairly flew
his boney legs moved so fast they could scarcely be seen and the wizard clung fast to the seat and yelled whoa
at the top of his voice
iim fraid heshes running away
gasped dorothy
i know he is said zeb but no bear can catch him if he keeps up that gaitand the harness or the buggy dont break
dorothy nearly went with them but she was holding fast to the iron rail of the seat and that saved her
she squeezed the kitten though until it screeched and then the old cabhorse made several curious sounds that led the little girl to suspect he was laughing at them all
illustration
the braided man of pyramid mountain
the mountain before them was shaped like a cone and was so tall that its point was lost in the clouds
directly facing the place where jim had stopped was an arched opening leading to a broad stairway
at the foot of the stairs was a sign reading warning
these steps lead to the land of the gargoyles
i wonder how jim is ever going to draw the buggy up so many stairs said dorothy gravely
no trouble at all declared the horse with a contemptuous neigh
still i dont care to drag any passengers
youll all have to walk
suppose the stairs get steeper
suggested zeb doubtfully
then youll have to boost the buggywheels thats all answered jim
well try it anyway said the wizard
its the only way to get out of the valley of voe
so they began to ascend the stairs dorothy and the wizard first jim next drawing the buggy and then zeb to watch that nothing happened to the harness
the light was dim and soon they mounted into total darkness so that the wizard was obliged to get out his lanterns to light the way
but this enabled them to proceed steadily until they came to a landing where there was a rift in the side of the mountain that let in both light and air
looking through this opening they could see the valley of voe lying far below them the cottages seeming like toy houses from that distance
after resting a few moments they resumed their climb and still the stairs were broad and low enough for jim to draw the buggy easily after him
the old horse panted a little and had to stop often to get his breath
at such times they were all glad to wait for him for continually climbing up stairs is sure to make ones legs ache
they wound about always going upward for some time
the lights from the lanterns dimly showed the way but it was a gloomy journey and they were pleased when a broad streak of light ahead assured them they were coming to a second landing
here one side of the mountain had a great hole in it like the mouth of a cavern and the stairs stopped at the near edge of the floor and commenced ascending again at the opposite edge
the opening in the mountain was on the side opposite to the valley of
voe and our travellers looked out upon a strange scene
below them was a vast space at the bottom of which was a black sea with rolling billows through which little tongues of flame constantly shot up
just above them and almost on a level with their platform were banks of rolling clouds which constantly shifted position and changed color
the blues and greys were very beautiful and dorothy noticed that on the cloud banks sat or reclined fleecy shadowy forms of beautiful beings who must have been the cloud fairies
mortals who stand upon the earth and look up at the sky cannot often distinguish these forms but our friends were now so near to the clouds that they observed the dainty fairies very clearly
are they real
asked zeb in an awed voice
of course replied dorothy softly
they are the cloud fairies
they seem like openwork remarked the boy gazing intently
if i should squeeze one there wouldnt be anything left of it
in the open space between the clouds and the black bubbling sea far beneath could be seen an occasional strange bird winging its way swiftly through the air
these birds were of enormous size and reminded
zeb of the rocs he had read about in the arabian nights
they had fierce eyes and sharp talons and beaks and the children hoped none of them would venture into the cavern
well i declare
suddenly exclaimed the little wizard
what in the world is this
they turned around and found a man standing on the floor in the center of the cave who bowed very politely when he saw he had attracted their attention
he was a very old man bent nearly double but the queerest thing about him was his white hair and beard
these were so long that they reached to his feet and both the hair and the beard were carefully plaited into many braids and the end of each braid fastened with a bow of colored ribbon
where did you come from
asked dorothy wonderingly
no place at all answered the man with the braids that is not recently
once i lived on top the earth but for many years i have had my factory in this spothalf way up pyramid mountain
are we only half way up
enquired the boy in a discouraged tone
i believe so my lad replied the braided man
but as i have never been in either direction down or up since i arrived i cannot be positive whether it is exactly half way or not
have you a factory in this place
asked the wizard who had been examining the strange personage carefully
to be sure said the other
i am a great inventor you must know and
i manufacture my products in this lonely spot
what are your products
enquired the wizard
well i make assorted flutters for flags and bunting and a superior grade of rustles for ladies silk gowns
i thought so said the wizard with a sigh
may we examine some of these articles
illustration the cloud fairies
illustration the braided man
yes indeed come into my shop please and the braided man turned and led the way into a smaller cave where he evidently lived
here on a broad shelf were several cardboard boxes of various sizes each tied with cotton cord
this said the man taking up a box and handling it gently contains twelve dozen rustlesenough to last any lady a year
will you buy it my dear
he asked addressing dorothy
my gown isnt silk she said smiling
never mind
when you open the box the rustles will escape whether you are wearing a silk dress or not said the man seriously
then he picked up another box
in this he continued are many assorted flutters
they are invaluable to make flags flutter on a still day when there is no wind
you sir turning to the wizard ought to have this assortment
once you have tried my goods i am sure you will never be without them
i have no money with me said the wizard evasively
i do not want money returned the braided man for i could not spend it in this deserted place if i had it
but i would like very much a blue hairribbon
you will notice my braids are tied with yellow pink brown red green white and black but i have no blue ribbons
ill get you one
cried dorothy who was sorry for the poor man so she ran back to the buggy and took from her suitcase a pretty blue ribbon
it did her good to see how the braided mans eyes sparkled when he received this treasure
you have made me very very happy my dear
he exclaimed and then he insisted on the wizard taking the box of flutters and the little girl accepting the box of rustles
you may need them some time he said and there is really no use in my manufacturing these things unless somebody uses them
why did you leave the surface of the earth
enquired the wizard
i could not help it
it is a sad story but if you will try to restrain your tears i will tell you about it
on earth i was a manufacturer of
imported holes for american swiss cheese and i will acknowledge that i supplied a superior article which was in great demand
also i made pores for porous plasters and highgrade holes for doughnuts and buttons
finally i invented a new adjustable posthole which i thought would make my fortune
i manufactured a large quantity of these postholes and having no room in which to store them i set them all end to end and put the top one in the ground
that made an extraordinary long hole as you may imagine and reached far down into the earth and as i leaned over it to try to see to the bottom i lost my balance and tumbled in
here then i made my home and although it is a lonely place i amuse myself making rustles and flutters and so get along very nicely
so they politely bade him good day and went back to the outer cavern to resume their journey
illustration
they meet the wooden gargoyles
another breathless climb brought our adventurers to a third landing where there was a rift in the mountain
on peering out all they could see was rolling banks of clouds so thick that they obscured all else
but the travellers were obliged to rest and while they were sitting on the rocky floor the wizard felt in his pocket and brought out the nine tiny piglets
to his delight they were now plainly visible which proved that they had passed beyond the influence of the magical valley of voe
why we can see each other again
cried one joyfully
yes sighed eureka and i also can see you again and the sight makes me dreadfully hungry
wizard may i eat just one of the fat little piglets
youd never miss one of them im sure
what a horrid savage beast
exclaimed a piglet and after weve been such good friends too and played with one another
when im not hungry i love to play with you all said the kitten demurely but when my stomach is empty it seems that nothing would fill it so nicely as a fat piglet
and we trusted you so
said another of the nine reproachfully
and thought you were respectable
said another
it seems we were mistaken declared a third looking at the kitten timorously no one with such murderous desires should belong to our party im sure
you see eureka remarked dorothy reprovingly you are making yourself disliked
there are certain things proper for a kitten to eat but i never heard of a kitten eating a pig under any cirstances
did you ever see such little pigs before
asked the kitten
they are no bigger than mice and im sure mice are proper for me to eat
it isnt the bigness dear its the variety replied the girl
these are mr
wizards pets just as you are my pet and it wouldnt be any more proper for you to eat them than it would be for jim to eat you
and thats just what i shall do if you dont let those little balls of pork alone said jim glaring at the kitten with his round big eyes
if you injure any one of them ill chew you up instantly
the kitten looked at the horse thoughtfully as if trying to decide whether he meant it or not
in that case she said ill leave them alone
you havent many teeth left jim but the few you have are sharp enough to make me shudder
so the piglets will be perfectly safe hereafter as far as i am concerned
that is right eureka remarked the wizard earnestly
let us all be a happy family and love one another
eureka yawned and stretched herself
ive always loved the piglets she said but they dont love me
no one can love a person hes afraid of asserted dorothy
if you behave and dont scare the little pigs im sure theyll grow very fond of you
the wizard now put the nine tiny ones back into his pocket and the journey was resumed
we must be pretty near the top now said the boy as they climbed wearily up the dark winding stairway
the country of the gurgles cant be far from the top of the earth remarked dorothy
it isnt very nice down here
id like to get home again im sure
no one replied to this because they found they needed all their breath for the climb
the stairs had become narrower and zeb and the wizard often had to help jim pull the buggy from one step to another or keep it from jamming against the rocky walls
at last however a dim light appeared ahead of them which grew clearer and stronger as they advanced
thank goodness were nearly there
panted the little wizard
jim who was in advance saw the last stair before him and stuck his head above the rocky sides of the stairway
then he halted ducked down and began to back up so that he nearly fell with the buggy onto the others
lets go down again
he said in his hoarse voice
snapped the tired wizard
whats the matter with you old man
everything grumbled the horse
ive taken a look at this place and its no fit country for real creatures to go to
everythings dead up thereno flesh or blood or growing thing anywhere
never mind we cant turn back said dorothy and we dont intend to stay there anyhow
its dangerous growled jim in a stubborn tone
see here my good steed broke in the wizard little dorothy and i have been in many queer countries in our travels and always escaped without harm
weve even been to the marvelous land of ozhavent we
so we dont much care what the country of the gargoyles is like
go ahead jim and whatever happens well make the best of it
all right answered the horse this is your excursion and not mine so if you get into trouble dont blame me
with this speech he bent forward and dragged the buggy up the remaining steps
the others followed and soon they were all standing upon a broad platform and gazing at the most curious and startling sight their eyes had ever beheld
the country of the gargoyles is all wooden
exclaimed zeb and so it was
the ground was sawdust and the pebbles scattered around were hard knots from trees worn smooth in course of time
there were odd wooden houses with carved wooden flowers in the front yards
the treetrunks were of coarse wood but the leaves of the trees were shavings
the patches of grass were splinters of wood and where neither grass nor sawdust showed was a solid wooden flooring
wooden birds fluttered among the trees and wooden cows were browsing upon the wooden grass but the most amazing things of all were the wooden peoplethe creatures known as gargoyles
these were very numerous for the palace was thickly inhabited and a large group of the queer people clustered near gazing sharply upon the strangers who had emerged from the long spiral stairway
the gargoyles were very small of stature being less than three feet in height
their bodies were round their legs short and thick and their arms extraordinarily long and stout
their heads were too big for their bodies and their faces were decidedly ugly to look upon
some had long curved noses and chins small eyes and wide grinning mouths
others had flat noses protruding eyes and ears that were shaped like those of an elephant
there were many types indeed scarcely two being alike but all were equally disagreeable in appearance
this noiseless motion was one of the most peculiar things about the
they made no sounds at all either in flying or trying to speak and they conversed mainly by means of quick signals made with their wooden fingers or lips
neither was there any sound to be heard anywhere throughout the wooden country
the birds did not sing nor did the cows moo yet there was more than ordinary activity everywhere
in turn the wizard and the children the horse and the kitten examined the
gargoyles with the same silent attention
theres going to be trouble im sure remarked the horse
unhitch those tugs zeb and set me free from the buggy so i can fight comfortably
jims right sighed the wizard
theres going to be trouble and my sword isnt stout enough to cut up those wooden bodiesso i shall have to get out my revolvers
he got his satchel from the buggy and opening it took out two deadly looking revolvers that made the children shrink back in alarm just to look at
what harm can the gurgles do
asked dorothy
they have no weapons to hurt us with
each of their arms is a wooden club answered the little man and im sure the creatures mean mischief by the looks of their eyes
even these revolvers can merely succeed in damaging a few of their wooden bodies and after that we will be at their mercy
but why fight at all in that case
asked the girl
so i may die with a clear conscience returned the wizard gravely
its every mans duty to do the best he knows how and im going to do it
wish i had an axe said zeb who by now had unhitched the horse
if we had known we were coming we might have brought along several other useful things responded the wizard
but we dropped into this adventure rather unexpectedly
the gargoyles had backed away a distance when they heard the sound of talking for although our friends had spoken in low tones their words seemed loud in the silence surrounding them
the horse had especially attracted their notice because it was the biggest and strangest creature they had ever seen so it became the center of their first attack
but jim was ready for them and when he saw them coming he turned his heels toward them and began kicking out as hard as he could
went his ironshod hoofs against the wooden bodies of the
gargoyles and they were battered right and left with such force that they scattered like straws in the wind
but the noise and clatter seemed as dreadful to them as jims heels for all who were able swiftly turned and flew away to a great distance
the others picked themselves up from the ground one by one and quickly rejoined their fellows so for a moment the horse thought he had won the fight with ease
but the wizard was not so confident
those wooden things are impossible to hurt he said and all the damage jim has done to them is to knock a few splinters from their noses and ears
that cannot make them look any uglier im sure and it is my opinion they will soon renew the attack
what made them fly away
asked dorothy
the noise of course
dont you remember how the champion escaped them by shouting his battlecry
suppose we escape down the stairs too suggested the boy
we have time just now and id rather face the invisble bears than those wooden imps
no returned dorothy stoutly it wont do to go back for then we would never get home
lets fight it out
that is what i advise said the wizard
they havent defeated us yet and jim is worth a whole army
but the gargoyles were clever enough not to attack the horse the next time
they advanced in a great swarm having been joined by many more of their kind and they flew straight over jims head to where the others were standing
the wizard raised one of his revolvers and fired into the throng of his enemies and the shot resounded like a clap of thunder in that silent place
some of the wooden beings fell flat upon the ground where they quivered and trembled in every limb but most of them managed to wheel and escape again to a distance
zeb ran and picked up one of the gargoyles that lay nearest to him
the top of its head was carved into a crown and the wizards bullet had struck it exactly in the left eye which was a hard wooden knot
half of the bullet stuck in the wood and half stuck out so it had been the jar and the sudden noise that had knocked the creature down more than the fact that it was really hurt
before this crowned gargoyle had recovered himself zeb had wound a strap several times around its body confining its wings and arms so that it could not move
then having tied the wooden creature securely the boy buckled the strap and tossed his prisoner into the buggy
by that time the others had all retired
illustration
a wonderful escape
for a while the enemy hesitated to renew the attack
then a few of them advanced until another shot from the wizards revolver made them retreat
thats fine said zeb
weve got em on the run now sure enough
but only for a time replied the wizard shaking his head gloomily
these revolvers are good for six shots each but when those are gone we shall be helpless
the gargoyles seemed to realize this for they sent a few of their band time after time to attack the strangers and draw the fire from the little mans revolvers
in this way none of them was shocked by the dreadful report more than once for the main band kept far away and each time a new company was sent into the battle
when the wizard had fired all of his twelve bullets he had caused no damage to the enemy except to stun a few by the noise and so he was no nearer to victory than in the beginning of the fray
illustration the wizard fired into the throng
what shall we do now
asked dorothy anxiously
lets yellall together said zeb
and fight at the same time added the wizard
we will get near jim so that he can help us and each one must take some weapon and do the best he can
ill use my sword although it isnt much account in this affair
dorothy must take her parasol and open it suddenly when the wooden folks attack her
i havent anything for you zeb
ill use the king said the boy and pulled his prisoner out of the buggy
the bound gargoyles arms extended far out beyond its head so by grasping its wrists zeb found the king made a very good club
the boy was strong for one of his years having always worked upon a farm so he was likely to prove more dangerous to the enemy than the wizard
when the next company of gargoyles advanced our adventurers began yelling as if they had gone mad
even the kitten gave a dreadfully shrill scream and at the same time jim the cabhorse neighed loudly
this daunted the enemy for a time but the defenders were soon out of breath
perceiving this as well as the fact that there were no more of the awful bangs to come from the revolvers the gargoyles advanced in a swarm as thick as bees so that the air was filled with them
dorothy squatted upon the ground and put up her parasol which nearly covered her and proved a great protection
the wizards swordblade snapped into a dozen pieces at the first blow he struck against the wooden people
the horse performed some wonderful kicking and even eureka assisted when she leaped bodily upon the gargoyles and scratched and bit at them like a wildcat
but all this bravery amounted to nothing at all
the wooden things wound their long arms around zeb and the wizard and held them fast
dorothy was captured in the same way and numbers of the gargoyles clung to
jims legs so weighting him down that the poor beast was helpless
eureka made a desperate dash to escape and scampered along the ground like a streak but a grinning gargoyle flew after her and grabbed her before she had gone very far
the houses of this city had many corners being square and sixsided and eightsided
they were towerlike in shape and the best of them seemed old and weatherworn yet all were strong and substantial
to one of these houses which had neither doors nor windows but only one broad opening far up underneath the roof the prisoners were brought by their captors
the gargoyles roughly pushed them into the opening where there was a platform and then flew away and left them
as they had no wings the strangers could not fly away and if they jumped down from such a height they would surely be killed
the creatures had sense enough to reason that way and the only mistake they made was in supposing the earth people were unable to overcome such ordinary difficulties
when eurekas captor had thrown the kitten after the others the last gargoyle silently disappeared leaving our friends to breathe freely once more
what an awful fight
said dorothy catching her breath in little gasps
oh i dont know purred eureka smoothing her ruffled fur with her paw we didnt manage to hurt anybody and nobody managed to hurt us
thank goodness we are together again even if we are prisoners sighed the little girl
i wonder why they didnt kill us on the spot remarked zeb who had lost his king in the struggle
they are probably keeping us for some ceremony the wizard answered reflectively but there is no doubt they intend to kill us as dead as possible in a short time
as dead as possble would be pretty dead wouldnt it
asked dorothy
yes my dear
but we have no need to worry about that just now
let us examine our prison and see what it is like
the space underneath the roof where they stood permitted them to see on all sides of the tall building and they looked with much curiosity at the city spread out beneath them
everything visible was made of wood and the scene seemed stiff and extremely unnatural
from their platform a stair descended into the house and the children and the wizard explored it after lighting a lantern to show them the way
several stories of empty rooms rewarded their search but nothing more so after a time they came back to the platform again
in this country as in all others they had visited underneath the earths surface there was no night a constant and strong light coming from some unknown source
looking out they could see into some of the houses near them where there were open windows in abundance and were able to mark the forms of the wooden gargoyles moving about in their dwellings
this seems to be their time of rest observed the wizard
all people need rest even if they are made of wood and as there is no night here they select a certain time of the day in which to sleep or doze
i feel sleepy myself remarked zeb yawning
why wheres eureka
cried dorothy suddenly
they all looked around but the kitten was no place to be seen
shes gone out for a walk said jim gruffly
on the roof
asked the girl
no she just dug her claws into the wood and climbed down the sides of this house to the ground
she couldnt climb down jim said dorothy
to climb means to go up
who said so
demanded the horse
my schoolteacher said so and she knows a lot jim
to climb down is sometimes used as a figure of speech remarked the
well this was a figure of a cat said jim and she went down anyhow whether she climbed or crept
how careless eureka is exclaimed the girl much distressed
the gurgles will get her sure
chuckled the old cabhorse theyre not gurgles little maid theyre gargoyles
never mind theyll get eureka whatever theyre called
no they wont said the voice of the kitten and eureka herself crawled over the edge of the platform and sat down quietly upon the floor
wherever have you been eureka
asked dorothy sternly
watching the wooden folks
theyre too funny for anything dorothy
just now they are all going to bed andwhat do you think
they unhook the hinges of their wings and put them in a corner until they wake up again
what the hinges
no the wings
that said zeb explains why this house is used by them for a prison
if any of the gargoyles act badly and have to be put in jail they are brought here and their wings unhooked and taken away from them until they promise to be good
the wizard had listened intently to what eureka had said
i wish we had some of those loose wings he said
could we fly with them
asked dorothy
i think so
if the gargoyles can unhook the wings then the power to fly lies in the wings themselves and not in the wooden bodies of the people who wear them
so if we had the wings we could probably fly as well as they doat least while we are in their country and under the spell of its magic
but how would it help us to be able to fly
questioned the girl
come here said the little man and took her to one of the corners of the building
do you see that big rock standing on the hillside yonder
he continued pointing with his finger
yes its a good way off but i can see it she replied
well inside that rock which reaches up into the clouds is an archway very much like the one we entered when we climbed the spiral stairway from the valley of voe
ill get my spyglass and then you can see it more plainly
he fetched a small but powerful telescope which had been in his satchel and by its aid the little girl clearly saw the opening
where does it lead to
that i cannot tell said the wizard but we cannot now be far below the earths surface and that entrance may lead to another stairway that will bring us on top of our world again where we belong
so if we had the wings and could escape the gargoyles we might fly to that rock and be saved
ill get you the wings said zeb who had thoughtfully listened to all this
that is if the kitten will show me where they are
but how can you get down
enquired the girl wonderingly
for answer zeb began to unfasten jims harness strap by strap and to buckle one piece to another until he had made a long leather strip that would reach to the ground
illustration the fight with the gargoyles
i can climb down that all right he said
no you cant remarked jim with a twinkle in his round eyes
you may go down but you can only climb up
well ill climb up when i get back then said the boy with a laugh
now eureka youll have to show me the way to those wings
you must be very quiet warned the kitten for if you make the least noise the gargoyles will wake up
they can hear a pin drop
im not going to drop a pin said zeb
he had fastened one end of the strap to a wheel of the buggy and now he let the line dangle over the side of the house
be careful cautioned dorothy earnestly
i will said the boy and let himself slide over the edge
the girl and the wizard leaned over and watched zeb work his way carefully downward hand over hand until he stood upon the ground below
eureka clung with her claws to the wooden side of the house and let herself down easily
then together they crept away to enter the low doorway of a neighboring dwelling
the watchers waited in breathless suspense until the boy again appeared his arms now full of the wooden wings
when he came to where the strap was hanging he tied the wings all in a bunch to the end of the line and the wizard drew them up
then the line was let down again for zeb to climb up by
eureka quickly followed him and soon they were all standing together upon the platform with eight of the much prized wooden wings beside them
the boy was no longer sleepy but full of energy and excitement
he put the harness together again and hitched jim to the buggy
then with the
wizards help he tried to fasten some of the wings to the old cabhorse
this was no easy task because half of each one of the hinges of the wings was missing it being still fastened to the body of the gargoyle who had used it
they were a bit wiggley but secure enough if only the harness held together
the other four wings were then fastened to the buggy two on each side for the buggy must bear the weight of the children and the wizard as it flew through the air
illustration jim fluttered and floundered through the air
these preparations had not consumed a great deal of time but the sleeping gargoyles were beginning to wake up and move around and soon some of them would be hunting for their missing wings
so the prisoners resolved to leave their prison at once
they mounted into the buggy dorothy holding eureka safe in her lap
the girl sat in the middle of the seat with zeb and the wizard on each side of her
when all was ready the boy shook the reins and said fly away jim
which wings must i flop first
asked the cabhorse undecidedly
flop them all together suggested the wizard
some of them are crooked objected the horse
never mind we will steer with the wings on the buggy said zeb
just you light out and make for that rock jim and dont waste any time about it either
so the horse gave a groan flopped its four wings all together and flew away from the platform
the only thing that anyone could complain of with justice was the fact that they wobbled first up and then down as if the road were rocky instead of being as smooth as the air could make it
the main point however was that they flew and flew swiftly if a bit unevenly toward the rock for which they had headed
illustration
the den of the dragonettes
our friends had a good start and were able to maintain it for with their eight wings they could go just as fast as could the gargoyles
all the way to the great rock the wooden people followed them and when jim finally alighted at the mouth of the cavern the pursuers were still some distance away
but im afraid theyll catch us yet said dorothy greatly excited
no we must stop them declared the wizard
quick zeb help me pull off these wooden wings
they tore off the wings for which they had no further use and the
wizard piled them in a heap just outside the entrance to the cavern
then he poured over them all the kerosene oil that was left in his oilcan and lighting a match set fire to the pile
the flames leaped up at once and the bonfire began to smoke and roar and crackle just as the great army of wooden gargoyles arrived
the creatures drew back at once being filled with fear and horror for such a dreadful thing as a fire they had never before known in all the history of their wooden land
inside the archway were several doors leading to different rooms built into the mountain and zeb and the wizard lifted these wooden doors from their hinges and tossed them all on the flames
that will prove a barrier for some time to come said the little man smiling pleasantly all over his wrinkled face at the success of their stratagem
perhaps the flames will set fire to all that miserable wooden country and if it does the loss will be very small and the
gargoyles never will be missed
but come my children let us explore the mountain and discover which way we must go in order to escape from this cavern which is getting to be almost as hot as a bakeoven
to their disappointment there was within this mountain no regular flight of steps by means of which they could mount to the earths surface
a sort of inclined tunnel led upward for a way and they found the floor of it both rough and steep
then a sudden turn brought them to a narrow gallery where the buggy could not pass
this delayed and bothered them for a while because they did not wish to leave the buggy behind them
it carried their baggage and was useful to ride in wherever there were good roads and since it had accompanied them so far in their travels they felt it their duty to preserve it
so zeb and the wizard set to work and took off the wheels and the top and then they put the buggy edgewise so it would take up the smallest space
in this position they managed with the aid of the patient cabhorse to drag the vehicle through the narrow part of the passage
it was not a great distance fortunately and when the path grew broader they put the buggy together again and proceeded more comfortably
anyhow said dorothy weve scaped those awful gurgles and thats one comfort
illustration why its a dragon
probably the gargoyles are still busy trying to put out the fire returned the wizard
but even if they succeeded in doing that it would be very difficult for them to fly amongst these rocks so i am sure we need fear them no longer
sometimes they had to climb over heaps of loose rock where jim could scarcely drag the buggy
at such times dorothy
zeb and the wizard all pushed behind and lifted the wheels over the roughest places so they managed by dint of hard work to keep going
but the little party was both weary and discouraged when at last on turning a sharp corner the wanderers found themselves in a vast cave arching high over their heads and having a smooth level floor
the cave was circular in shape and all around its edge near to the ground appeared groups of dull yellow lights two of them being always side by side
these were motionless at first but soon began to flicker more brightly and to sway slowly from side to side and then up and down
what sort of a place is this
asked the boy trying to see more clearly through the gloom
i cannot imagine im sure answered the wizard also peering about
snarled eureka arching her back until her hair stood straight on end its a den of alligators or crocodiles or some other dreadful creatures
dont you see their terrible eyes
eureka sees better in the dark than we can whispered dorothy
tell us dear what do the creatures look like
she asked addressing her pet
i simply cant describe em answered the kitten shuddering
their eyes are like pieplates and their mouths like coalscuttles
but their bodies dont seem very big
where are they
enquired the girl
they are in little pockets all around the edge of this cavern
dorothyyou cant imagine what horrid things they are
theyre uglier than the gargoyles
be careful how you criticise your neighbors spoke a rasping voice near by
as a matter of fact you are rather uglylooking creatures yourselves and im sure mother has often told us we were the loveliest and prettiest things in all the world
hearing these words our friends turned in the direction of the sound and the wizard held his lanterns so that their light would flood one of the little pockets in the rock
why its a dragon
he exclaimed
no answered the owner of the big yellow eyes which were blinking at them so steadily you are wrong about that
we hope to grow to be dragons some day but just now were only dragonettes
whats that
asked dorothy gazing fearfully at the great scaley head the yawning mouth and the big eyes
young dragons of course but we are not allowed to call ourselves real dragons until we get our full growth was the reply
the big dragons are very proud and dont think children amount to much but mother says that some day we will all be very powerful and important
where is your mother
asked the wizard anxiously looking around
she has gone up to the top of the earth to hunt for our dinner
if she has good luck she will bring us an elephant or a brace of rhinoceri or perhaps a few dozen people to stay our hunger
oh are you hungry
enquired dorothy drawing back
very said the dragonette snapping its jaws
andanddo you eat people
to be sure when we can get them
but theyve been very scarce for a few years and we usually have to be content with elephants or buffaloes answered the creature in a regretful tone
how old are you
enquired zeb who stared at the yellow eyes as if fascinated
quite young i grieve to say and all of my brothers and sisters that you see here are practically my own age
if i remember rightly we were sixtysix years old the day before yesterday
but that isnt young
cried dorothy in amazement
drawled the dragonette it seems to me very babyish
how old is your mother
asked the girl
mothers about two thousand years old but she carelessly lost track of her age a few centuries ago and skipped several hundreds
shes a little fussy you know and afraid of growing old being a widow and still in her prime
i should think she would be agreed dorothy
then after a moments thought she asked are we friends or enemies
i mean will you be good to us or do you intend to eat us
as for that we dragonettes would love to eat you my child but unfortunately mother has tied all our tails around the rocks at the back of our individual caves so that we can not crawl out to get you
if you choose to come nearer we will make a mouthful of you in a wink but unless you do you will remain quite safe
there was a regretful accent in the creatures voice and at the words all the other dragonettes sighed dismally
dorothy felt relieved
presently she asked why did your mother tie your tails
oh she is sometimes gone for several weeks on her hunting trips and if we were not tied we would crawl all over the mountain and fight with each other and get into a lot of mischief
mother usually knows what she is about but she made a mistake this time for you are sure to escape us unless you come too near and you probably wont do that
said the little girl
we dont wish to be eaten by such awful beasts
permit me to say returned the dragonette that you are rather impolite to call us names knowing that we cannot resent your insults
we consider ourselves very beautiful in appearance for mother has told us so and she knows
and we are of an excellent family and have a pedigree that i challenge any humans to equal as it extends back about twenty thousand years to the time of the famous green dragon of
atlantis who lived in a time when humans had not yet been created
can you match that pedigree little girl
well said dorothy i was born on a farm in kansas and i guess thats being just as spectable and haughty as living in a cave with your tail tied to a rock
if it isnt ill have to stand it thats all
tastes differ murmured the dragonette slowly drooping its scaley eyelids over its yellow eyes until they looked like halfmoons
being reassured by the fact that the creatures could not crawl out of their rockpockets the children and the wizard now took time to examine them more closely
the heads of the dragonettes were as big as barrels and covered with hard greenish scales that glittered brightly under the light of the lanterns
it occurs to me said the wizard that we ought to get out of this place before the mother dragon comes back
dont hurry called one of the dragonettes mother will be glad to meet you im sure
you may be right replied the wizard but were a little particular about associating with strangers
will you kindly tell us which way your mother went to get on top the earth
that is not a fair question to ask us declared another dragonette
for if we told you truly you might escape us altogether and if we told you an untruth we would be naughty and deserve to be punished
then decided dorothy we must find our way out the best we can
they selected one of these at a venture and hurried along it as fast as they could go for they had no idea when the mother dragon would be back and were very anxious not to make her acquaintance
illustration
ozma uses the magic belt
for a considerable distance the way led straight upward in a gentle incline and the wanderers made such good progress that they grew hopeful and eager thinking they might see sunshine at any minute
but at length they came unexpectedly upon a huge rock that shut off the passage and blocked them from proceeding a single step farther
this rock was separate from the rest of the mountain and was in motion turning slowly around and around as if upon a pivot
when first they came to it there was a solid wall before them but presently it revolved until there was exposed a wide smooth path across it to the other side
this appeared so unexpectedly that they were unprepared to take advantage of it at first and allowed the rocky wall to swing around again before they had decided to pass over
but they knew now that there was a means of escape and so waited patiently until the path appeared for the second time
the children and the wizard rushed across the moving rock and sprang into the passage beyond landing safely though a little out of breath
they heard a crunching grinding sound a loud snap and the turntable came to a stop with its broadest surface shutting off the path from which they had come
never mind said zeb we dont want to get back anyhow
im not so sure of that returned dorothy
the mother dragon may come down and catch us here
it is possible agreed the wizard if this proves to be the path she usually takes
but i have been examining this tunnel and i do not see any signs of so large a beast having passed through it
then were all right said the girl for if the dragon went the other way she cant possbly get to us now
of course not my dear
but there is another thing to consider
the mother dragon probably knows the road to the earths surface and if she went the other way then we have come the wrong way said the wizard thoughtfully
cried dorothy
that would be unlucky wouldnt it
unless this passage also leads to the top of the earth said
for my part if we manage to get out of here ill be glad it isnt the way the dragon goes
so will i returned dorothy
its enough to have your pedigree flung in your face by those saucy dragonettes
no one knows what the mother might do
they now moved on again creeping slowly up another steep incline
the lanterns were beginning to grow dim and the wizard poured the remaining oil from one into the other so that the one light would last longer
but their journey was almost over for in a short time they reached a small cave from which there was no further outlet
they did not realize their ill fortune at first for their hearts were gladdened by the sight of a ray of sunshine coming through a small crack in the roof of the cave far overhead
but when the adventurers looked more carefully around them they discovered that they were in a strong prison from which there was no hope of escape
but were almost on earth again cried dorothy for there is the sunthe most beauful sun that shines
and she pointed eagerly at the crack in the distant roof
almost on earth isnt being there said the kitten in a discontented tone
it wouldnt be possible for even me to get up to that crackor through it if i got there
it appears that the path ends here announced the wizard gloomily
and there is no way to go back added zeb with a low whistle of perplexity
i was sure it would come to this in the end remarked the old cabhorse
folks dont fall into the middle of the earth and then get back again to tell of their adventuresnot in real life
and the whole thing has been unnatural because that cat and i are both able to talk your language and to understand the words you say
and so can the nine tiny piglets added eureka
dont forget them for i may have to eat them after all
ive heard animals talk before said dorothy and no harm came of it
were you ever before shut up in a cave far under the earth with no way of getting out
enquired the horse seriously
no answered dorothy
but dont you lose heart jim for im sure this isnt the end of our story by any means
the reference to the piglets reminded the wizard that his pets had not enjoyed much exercise lately and must be tired of their prison in his pocket
so he sat down upon the floor of the cave brought the piglets out one by one and allowed them to run around as much as they pleased
my dears he said to them im afraid ive got you into a lot of trouble and that you will never again be able to leave this gloomy cave
whats wrong
asked a piglet
weve been in the dark quite a while and you may as well explain what has happened
the wizard told them of the misfortune that had overtaken the wanderers
well said another piglet you are a wizard are you not
i am replied the little man
then you can do a few wizzes and get us out of this hole declared the tiny one with much confidence
i could if i happened to be a real wizard returned the master sadly
but im not my piggywees im a humbug wizard
cried several of the piglets together
you can ask dorothy said the little man in an injured tone
its true enough returned the girl earnestly
our friend oz is merely a humbug wizard for he once proved it to me
he can do several very wonderful thingsif he knows how
but he cant wiz a single thing if he hasnt the tools and machinery to work with
thank you my dear for doing me justice responded the wizard gratefully
to be accused of being a real wizard when im not is a slander i will not tamely submit to
but i am one of the greatest humbug wizards that ever lived and you will realize this when we have all starved together and our bones are scattered over the floor of this lonely cave
i dont believe well realize anything when it comes to that remarked dorothy who had been deep in thought
but im not going to scatter my bones just yet because i need them and you probly need yours too
we are helpless to escape sighed the wizard
we may be helpless answered dorothy smiling at him but there are others who can do more than we can
cheer up friends
im sure ozma will help us
exclaimed the wizard
who is ozma
the girl that rules the marvelous land of oz was the reply
shes a friend of mine for i met her in the land of ev not long ago and went to oz with her
for the second time
asked the wizard with great interest
the first time i went to oz i found you there ruling the emerald
after you went up in a balloon and escaped us i got back to
kansas by means of a pair of magical silver shoes
i remember those shoes said the little man nodding
they once belonged to the wicked witch
have you them here with you
no i lost them somewhere in the air explained the child
but the second time i went to the land of oz i owned the nome kings magic belt which is much more powerful than were the silver shoes
where is that magic belt
enquired the wizard who had listened with great interest
ozma has it for its powers wont work in a common ordinary country like the united states
anyone in a fairy country like the land of oz can do anything with it so i left it with my friend the princess ozma who used it to wish me in australia with uncle henry
and were you
asked zeb astonished at what he heard
of course in just a jiffy
and ozma has an enchanted picture hanging in her room that shows her the exact scene where any of her friends may be at any time she chooses
all she has to do is to say i wonder what
soandso is doing and at once the picture shows where her friend is and what the friend is doing
thats real magic mr
wizard isnt it
do you mean that princess ozma will see this cave in her enchanted picture and see all of us here and what we are doing
demanded zeb
of course when it is four oclock she replied with a laugh at his startled expression
and when you make a sign she will bring you to her in the land of oz
continued the boy
thats it exactly by means of the magic belt
then said the wizard you will be saved little dorothy and i am very glad of it
the rest of us will die much more cheerfully when we know you have escaped our sad fate
i wont die cheerfully
protested the kitten
theres nothing cheerful about dying that i could ever see although they say a cat has nine lives and so must die nine times
have you ever died yet
enquired the boy
no and im not anxious to begin said eureka
dont worry dear dorothy exclaimed ill hold you in my arms and take you with me
take us too
cried the nine tiny piglets all in one breath
perhaps i can answered dorothy
couldnt you manage to hold me in your arms
asked the cabhorse
dorothy laughed
ill do better than that she promised for i can easily save you all once i am myself in the land of oz
they asked
by using the magic belt
all i need do is to wish you with me and there youll besafe in the royal palace
i built that palace and the emerald city too remarked the wizard in a thoughtful tone and id like to see them again for i was very happy among the munchkins and winkies and quadlings and gillikins
who are they
asked the boy
the four nations that inhabit the land of oz was the reply
i wonder if they would treat me nicely if i went there again
of course they would
declared dorothy
they are still proud of their former wizard and often speak of you kindly
do you happen to know whatever became of the tin woodman and the
he enquired
they live in oz yet said the girl and are very important people
and the cowardly lion
oh he lives there too with his friend the hungry tiger and billina is there because she liked the place better than kansas and wouldnt go with me to australia
im afraid i dont know the hungry tiger and billina said the wizard shaking his head
is billina a girl
no shes a yellow hen and a great friend of mine
youre sure to like
billina when you know her asserted dorothy
your friends sound like a menagerie remarked zeb uneasily
couldnt you wish me in some safer place than oz
dont worry replied the girl
youll just love the folks in oz when you get acquainted
what time is it mr
the little man looked at his watcha big silver one that he carried in his vest pocket
halfpast three he said
then we must wait for half an hour she continued but it wont take long after that to carry us all to the emerald city
they sat silently thinking for a time
then jim suddenly asked are there any horses in oz
only one replied dorothy and hes a sawhorse
a sawhorse
princess ozma once brought him to life with a witchpowder when she was a boy
was ozma once a boy
asked zeb wonderingly
yes a wicked witch enchanted her so she could not rule her kingdom
but shes a girl now and the sweetest loveliest girl in all the world
a sawhorse is a thing they saw boards on remarked jim with a sniff
it is when its not alive acknowledged the girl
but this sawhorse can trot as fast as you can jim and hes very wise too
ill race the miserable wooden donkey any day in the week
cried the cabhorse
dorothy did not reply to that
she felt that jim would know more about the sawhorse later on
the time dragged wearily enough to the eager watchers but finally the
wizard announced that four oclock had arrived and dorothy caught up the kitten and began to make the signal that had been agreed upon to the faraway invisible ozma
nothing seems to happen said zeb doubtfully
oh we must give ozma time to put on the magic belt replied the girl
she had scarcely spoken the words when she suddenly disappeared from the cave and with her went the kitten
there had been no sound of any kind and no warning
one moment dorothy sat beside them with the kitten in her lap and a moment later the horse the piglets the wizard and the boy were all that remained in the underground prison
illustration dorothy made the signal
i believe we will soon follow her announced the wizard in a tone of great relief for i know something about the magic of the fairyland that is called the land of oz
let us be ready for we may be sent for any minute
he put the piglets safely away in his pocket again and then he and zeb got into the buggy and sat expectantly upon the seat
will it hurt
asked the boy in a voice that trembled a little
not at all replied the wizard
it will all happen as quick as a wink
and that was the way it did happen
the cabhorse gave a nervous start and zeb began to rub his eyes to make sure he was not asleep
zeb shook the reins to rouse the cabhorse from his stupor of amazement for the people were beginning to gather around and stare at the strangers
cried the boy and at the word jim slowly trotted into the courtyard and drew the buggy along the jewelled driveway to the great entrance of the royal palace
illustration
old friends are reunited
the little man looked at her closely and then took both the maidens hands in his and shook them cordially
on my word he exclaimed its little jellia jambas pert and pretty as ever
why not mr
asked jellia bowing low
but im afraid you cannot rule the emerald city as you used to because we now have a beautiful princess whom everyone loves dearly
and the people will not willingly part with her added a tall soldier in a captaingenerals uniform
the wizard turned to look at him
did you not wear green whiskers at one time
yes said the soldier but i shaved them off long ago and since then
i have risen from a private to be the chief general of the royal
thats nice said the little man
but i assure you my good people that i do not wish to rule the emerald city he added earnestly
in that case you are very welcome
cried all the servants and it pleased the wizard to note the respect with which the royal retainers bowed before him
his fame had not been forgotten in the land of oz by any means
where is dorothy
enquired zeb anxiously as he left the buggy and stood beside his friend the little wizard
she is with the princess ozma in the private rooms of the palace replied jellia jamb
but she has ordered me to make you welcome and to show you to your apartments
the boy looked around him with wondering eyes
such magnificence and wealth as was displayed in this palace was more than he had ever dreamed of and he could scarcely believe that all the gorgeous glitter was real and not tinsel
whats to become of me
asked the horse uneasily
he had seen considerable of life in the cities in his younger days and knew that this regal palace was no place for him
it perplexed even jellia jamb for a time to know what to do with the animal
there are no stables here said the wizard unless some have been built since i went away
we have never needed them before answered jellia for the sawhorse lives in a room of the palace being much smaller and more natural in appearance than this great beast you have brought with you
do you mean that im a freak
asked jim angrily
oh no she hastened to say there may be many more like you in the place you came from but in oz any horse but a sawhorse is unusual
this mollified jim a little and after some thought the green maiden decided to give the cabhorse a room in the palace such a big building having many rooms that were seldom in use
so zeb unharnessed jim and several of the servants then led the horse around to the rear where they selected a nice large apartment that he could have all to himself
then jellia said to the wizard your own roomwhich was back of the great throne roomhas been vacant ever since you left us
would you like it again
yes indeed
returned the little man
it will seem like being at home again for i lived in that room for many many years
he knew the way to it and a servant followed him carrying his satchel
zeb was also escorted to a roomso grand and beautiful that he almost feared to sit in the chairs or lie upon the bed lest he might dim their splendor
he was all ready when an attendant came to escort him to the presence of the princess he followed bashfully and was ushered into a room more dainty and attractive than it was splendid
here he found dorothy seated beside a young girl so marvelously beautiful that the boy stopped suddenly with a gasp of admiration
but dorothy sprang up and ran to seize her friends hand drawing him impulsively toward the lovely princess who smiled most graciously upon her guest
then the wizard entered and his presence relieved the boys embarrassment
the little man was clothed in black velvet with many sparkling emerald ornaments decorating his breast but his bald head and wrinkled features made him appear more amusing than impressive
ozma had been quite curious to meet the famous man who had built the
emerald city and united the munchkins gillikins quadlings and winkies into one people so when they were all four seated at the dinner table the princess said please tell me mr
wizard whether you called yourself oz after this great country or whether you believe my country is called oz after you
it is a matter that i have long wished to enquire about because you are of a strange race and my own name is ozma
no one i am sure is better able to explain this mystery than you
that is true answered the little wizard therefore it will give me pleasure to explain my connection with your country
in the first place
i must tell you that i was born in omaha and my father who was a politician named me oscar zoroaster phadrig isaac norman henkle
emmannuel ambroise diggs diggs being the last name because he could think of no more to go before it
taken altogether it was a dreadfully long name to weigh down a poor innocent child and one of the hardest lessons i ever learned was to remember my own name
when i grew up i just called myself o
because the other initials were pinhead and that spelled pinhead which was a reflection on my intelligence
surely no one could blame you for cutting your name short said ozma sympathetically
but didnt you cut it almost too short
perhaps so replied the wizard
when a young man i ran away from home and joined a circus
i used to call myself a wizard and do tricks of ventriloquism
what does that mean
asked the princess
throwing my voice into any object i pleased to make it appear that the object was speaking instead of me
also i began to make balloon ascensions
on my balloon and on all the other articles i used in the circus i painted the two initials o
to show that those things belonged to me
one day my balloon ran away with me and brought me across the deserts to this beautiful country
when the people saw me come from the sky they naturally thought me some superior creature and bowed down before me
i told them i was a wizard and showed them some easy tricks that amazed them and when they saw the initials painted on the balloon they called me oz
now i begin to understand said the princess smiling
at that time continued the wizard busily eating his soup while talking there were four separate countries in this land each one of the four being ruled by a witch
but the people thought my power was greater than that of the witches and perhaps the witches thought so too for they never dared oppose me
over this land i ruled in peace for many years until i grew old and longed to see my native city once again
so when dorothy was first blown to this place by a cyclone i arranged to go away with her in a balloon but the balloon escaped too soon and carried me back alone
after many adventures i reached omaha only to find that all my old friends were dead or had moved away
so having nothing else to do
i joined a circus again and made my balloon ascensions until the earthquake caught me
that is quite a history said ozma but there is a little more history about the land of oz that you do not seem to understandperhaps for the reason that no one ever told it you
then the witches divided up the kingdom and ruled the four parts of it until you came here
that was why the people were so glad to see you and why they thought from your initials that you were their rightful ruler
but at that time said the wizard thoughtfully there were two good
witches and two wicked witches ruling in the land
yes replied ozma because a good witch had conquered mombi in the
north and glinda the good had conquered the evil witch in the south
mombi was still my grandfathers jailor and afterward my fathers jailor
when i was born she transformed me into a boy hoping that no one would ever recognize me and know that i was the rightful princess of the land of oz
but i escaped from her and am now the ruler of my people
i am very glad of that said the wizard and hope you will consider me one of your most faithful and devoted subjects
we owe a great deal to the wonderful wizard continued the princess for it was you who built this splendid emerald city
your people built it he answered
i only bossed the job as we say in omaha
but you ruled it wisely and well for many years said she and made the people proud of your magical art
so as you are now too old to wander abroad and work in a circus i offer you a home here as long as you live
you shall be the official wizard of my kingdom and be treated with every respect and consideration
i accept your kind offer with gratitude gracious princess the little man said in a soft voice and they could all see that teardrops were standing in his keen old eyes
it meant a good deal to him to secure a home like this
hes only a humbug wizard though said dorothy smiling at him
and that is the safest kind of a wizard to have replied ozma promptly
oz can do some good tricks humbug or no humbug announced zeb who was now feeling more at ease
he shall amuse us with his tricks tomorrow said the princess
i have sent messengers to summon all of dorothys old friends to meet her and give her welcome and they ought to arrive very soon now
indeed the dinner was no sooner finished than in rushed the scarecrow to hug dorothy in his padded arms and tell her how glad he was to see her again
the wizard was also most heartily welcomed by the straw man who was an important personage in the land of oz
how are your brains
enquired the little humbug as he grasped the soft stuffed hands of his old friend
working finely answered the scarecrow
im very certain oz that you gave me the best brains in the world for i can think with them day and night when all other brains are fast asleep
illustration dorothy and ozma
how long did you rule the emerald city after i left here
was the next question
quite awhile until i was conquered by a girl named general jinjur
ozma soon conquered her with the help of glinda the good and after that i went to live with nick chopper the tin woodman
just then a loud cackling was heard outside and when a servant threw open the door with a low bow a yellow hen strutted in
dorothy sprang forward and caught the fluffy fowl in her arms uttering at the same time a glad cry
oh billina
she said how fat and sleek youve grown
why shouldnt i
asked the hen in a sharp clear voice
i live on the fat of the landdont i ozma
you have everything you wish for said the princess
around billinas neck was a string of beautiful pearls and on her legs were bracelets of emeralds
she nestled herself comfortably in dorothys lap until the kitten gave a snarl of jealous anger and leaped up with a sharp claw fiercely bared to strike billina a blow
but the little girl gave the angry kitten such a severe cuff that it jumped down again without daring to scratch
how horrid of you eureka
cried dorothy
is that the way to treat my friends
you have queer friends seems to me replied the kitten in a surly tone
seems to me the same way said billina scornfully if that beastly cat is one of them
said dorothy sternly
i wont have any quarrelling in the
land of oz i can tell you
everybody lives in peace here and loves everybody else and unless you two billina and eureka make up and be friends ill take my magic belt and wish you both home again immejitly
they were both much frightened at the threat and promised meekly to be good
but it was never noticed that they became very warm friends for all of that
and now the tin woodman arrived his body most beautifully nickleplated so that it shone splendidly in the brilliant light of the room
the tin woodman loved dorothy most tenderly and welcomed with joy the return of the little old wizard
sir said he to the latter i never can thank you enough for the excellent heart you once gave me
it has made me many friends i assure you and it beats as kindly and lovingly today as it ever did
im glad to hear that said the wizard
i was afraid it would get moldy in that tin body of yours
not at all returned nick chopper
it keeps finely being preserved in my airtight chest
zeb was a little shy when first introduced to these queer people but they were so friendly and sincere that he soon grew to admire them very much even finding some good qualities in the yellow hen
but he became nervous again when the next visitor was announced
this said princess ozma is my friend mr
wogglebug t
who assisted me one time when i was in great distress and is now the
dean of the royal college of athletic science
ah said the wizard im pleased to meet so distinguished a personage
said the wogglebug pompously means highly magnified and t
means thoroughly educated
i am in reality a very big bug and doubtless the most intelligent being in all this broad domain
how well you disguise it said the wizard
but i dont doubt your word in the least
nobody doubts it sir replied the wogglebug and drawing a book from its pocket the strange insect turned its back on the company and sat down in a corner to read
illustration
jim the cabhorse
jim the cabhorse found himself in possession of a large room with a green marble floor and carved marble wainscoting which was so stately in its appearance that it would have awed anyone else
jim accepted it as a mere detail and at his command the attendants gave his coat a good rubbing combed his mane and tail and washed his hoofs and fetlocks
then they told him dinner would be served directly and he replied that they could not serve it too quickly to suit his convenience
first they brought him a steaming bowl of soup which the horse eyed in dismay
take that stuff away
he commanded
do you take me for a salamander
they obeyed at once and next served a fine large turbot on a silver platter with drawn gravey poured over it
cried jim with a sniff
do you take me for a tomcat
away with it
the servants were a little discouraged but soon they brought in a great tray containing two dozen nicely roasted quail on toast
said the horse now thoroughly provoked
do you take me for a weasel
how stupid and ignorant you are in the land of oz and what dreadful things you feed upon
is there nothing that is decent to eat in this palace
the trembling servants sent for the royal steward who came in haste and said what would your highness like for dinner
repeated jim who was unused to such titles
you are at least six feet high and that is higher than any other animal in this country said the steward
well my highness would like some oats declared the horse
we have no whole oats the steward replied with much defference
but there is any quantity of oatmeal which we often cook for breakfast
oatmeal is a breakfast dish added the steward humbly
ill make it a dinner dish said jim
fetch it on but dont cook it as you value your life
but the royal attendants did not heed the animals ill temper
they soon mixed a tub of oatmeal with a little water and
jim ate it with much relish
then the servants heaped a lot of rugs upon the floor and the old horse slept on the softest bed he had ever known in his life
jim stopped abruptly being startled and amazed
the sawhorse stopped at the same time and stared at the other with its queer protruding eyes which were mere knots in the log that formed its body
the legs of the
the ends of the wooden legs were shod with plates of solid gold and the saddle of the princess ozma which was of red leather set with sparkling diamonds was strapped to the clumsy body
illustration for goodness sake what sort of a being are you
jims eyes stuck out as much as those of the sawhorse and he stared at the creature with his ears erect and his long head drawn back until it rested against his arched neck
in this comical position the two horses circled slowly around each other for a while each being unable to realize what the singular thing might be which it now beheld for the first time
then jim exclaimed for goodness sake what sort of a being are you
im a sawhorse replied the other
oh i believe ive heard of you said the cabhorse but you are unlike anything that i expected to see
i do not doubt it the sawhorse observed with a tone of pride
i am considered quite unusual
you are indeed
but a rickety wooden thing like you has no right to be alive
i couldnt help it returned the other rather crestfallen
ozma sprinkled me with a magic powder and i just had to live
i know im not much account but im the only horse in all the land of oz so they treat me with great respect
you a horse
oh not a real one of course
there are no real horses here at all
but im a splendid imitation of one
jim gave an indignant neigh
look at me
behold a real horse
the wooden animal gave a start and then examined the other intently
is it possible that you are a real horse
he murmured
not only possible but true replied jim who was gratified by the impression he had created
it is proved by my fine points
for example look at the long hairs on my tail with which i can whisk away the flies
the flies never trouble me said the sawhorse
and notice my great strong teeth with which i nibble the grass
it is not necessary for me to eat observed the sawhorse
also examine my broad chest which enables me to draw deep full breaths said jim proudly
i have no need to breathe returned the other
no you miss many pleasures remarked the cabhorse pityingly
you do not know the relief of brushing away a fly that has bitten you nor the delight of eating delicious food nor the satisfaction of drawing a long breath of fresh pure air
you may be an imitation of a horse but youre a mighty poor one
oh i cannot hope ever to be like you sighed the sawhorse
but i am glad to meet at last a real horse
you are certainly the most beautiful creature i ever beheld
this praise won jim completely
to be called beautiful was a novelty in his experience
said he your chief fault my friend is in being made of wood and that i suppose you cannot help
real horses like myself are made of flesh and blood and bones
i can see the bones all right replied the sawhorse and they are admirable and distinct
also i can see the flesh
but the blood i suppose is tucked away inside
exactly said jim
what good is it
asked the sawhorse
jim did not know but he would not tell the sawhorse that
if anything cuts me he replied the blood runs out to show where i am cut
you poor thing
cannot even bleed when you are hurt
but i am never hurt said the sawhorse
once in a while i get broken up some but i am easily repaired and put in good order again
and i never feel a break or a splinter in the least
jim was almost tempted to envy the wooden horse for being unable to feel pain but the creature was so absurdly unnatural that he decided he would not change places with it under any circumstances
how did you happen to be shod with gold
princess ozma did that was the reply and it saves my legs from wearing out
weve had a good many adventures together ozma and i and she likes me
the cabhorse was about to reply when suddenly he gave a start and a neigh of terror and stood trembling like a leaf
for around the corner had come two enormous savage beasts treading so lightly that they were upon him before he was aware of their presence
jim was in the act of plunging down the path to escape when the sawhorse cried out stop my brother
stop real horse
these are friends and will do you no harm
jim hesitated eyeing the beasts fearfully
one was an enormous lion with clear intelligent eyes a tawney mane bushy and well kept and a body like yellow plush
the other was a great tiger with purple stripes around his lithe body powerful limbs and eyes that showed through the half closed lids like coals of fire
the huge forms of these monarchs of the forest and jungle were enough to strike terror to the stoutest heart and it is no wonder jim was afraid to face them
but the sawhorse introduced the stranger in a calm tone saying this noble horse is my friend the cowardly lion who is the valiant
king of the forest but at the same time a faithful vassal of princess
and this is the hungry tiger the terror of the jungle who longs to devour fat babies but is prevented by his conscience from doing so
these royal beasts are both warm friends of little dorothy and have come to the emerald city this morning to welcome her to our fairyland
hearing these words jim resolved to conquer his alarm
he bowed his head with as much dignity as he could muster toward the savage looking beasts who in return nodded in a friendly way
is not the real horse a beautiful animal
asked the sawhorse admiringly
that is doubtless a matter of taste returned the lion
in the forest he would be thought ungainly because his face is stretched out and his neck is uselessly long
his joints i notice are swollen and overgrown and he lacks flesh and is old in years
and dreadfully tough added the hungry tiger in a sad voice
my conscience would never permit me to eat so tough a morsel as the real
im glad of that said jim for i also have a conscience and it tells me not to crush in your skull with a blow of my powerful hoof
if he thought to frighten the striped beast by such language he was mistaken
the tiger seemed to smile and winked one eye slowly
you have a good conscience friend horse it said and if you attend to its teachings it will do much to protect you from harm
some day i will let you try to crush in my skull and afterward you will know more about tigers than you do now
any friend of dorothy remarked the cowardly lion must be our friend as well
so let us cease this talk of skull crushing and converse upon more pleasant subjects
have you breakfasted sir horse
not yet replied jim
but here is plenty of excellent clover so if you will excuse me i will eat now
hes a vegetarian remarked the tiger as the horse began to munch the clover
if i could eat grass i would not need a conscience for nothing could then tempt me to devour babies and lambs
just then dorothy who had risen early and heard the voices of the animals ran out to greet her old friends
she hugged both the lion and the tiger with eager delight but seemed to love the king of beasts a little better than she did his hungry friend having known him longer
as she entered the great hall a voice called out in a rather harsh tone what
are you here again
yes i am she answered looking all around to see where the voice came from
what brought you back
was the next question and dorothys eye rested on an antlered head hanging on the wall just over the fireplace and caught its lips in the act of moving
good gracious
she exclaimed
i thought you were stuffed
so i am replied the head
but once on a time i was part of the gump which ozma sprinkled with the powder of life
i was then for a time the
head of the finest flying machine that was ever known to exist and we did many wonderful things
afterward the gump was taken apart and i was put back on this wall but i can still talk when i feel in the mood which is not often
its very strange said the girl
what were you when you were first alive
that i have forgotten replied the gumps head and i do not think it is of much importance
but here comes ozma so id better hush up for the princess doesnt like me to chatter since she changed her name from
tip to ozma
just then the girlish ruler of oz opened the door and greeted dorothy with a goodmorning kiss
the little princess seemed fresh and rosy and in good spirits
breakfast is served dear she said and i am hungry
so dont let us keep it waiting a single minute
illustration illustration jim stood trembling like a leaf
the nine tiny piglets
after breakfast ozma announced that she had ordered a holiday to be observed throughout the emerald city in honor of her visitors
the people had learned that their old wizard had returned to them and all were anxious to see him again for he had always been a rare favorite
so first there was to be a grand procession through the streets after which the little old man was requested to perform some of his wizardries in the great throne room of the palace
in the afternoon there were to be games and races
the procession was very imposing
first came the imperial cornet band of
oz dressed in emerald velvet uniforms with slashes of peagreen satin and buttons of immense cut emeralds
they played the national air called the oz spangled banner and behind them were the standard bearers with the royal flag
this flag was divided into four quarters one being colored skyblue another pink a third lavender and a fourth white
in the center was a large emeraldgreen star and all over the four quarters were sewn spangles that glittered beautifully in the sunshine
the colors represented the four countries of oz and the green star the emerald city
just behind the royal standardbearers came the princess ozma in her royal chariot which was of gold encrusted with emeralds and diamonds set in exquisite designs
the chariot was drawn on this occasion by the
cowardly lion and the hungry tiger who were decorated with immense pink and blue bows
in the chariot rode ozma and dorothy the former in splendid raiment and wearing her royal coronet while the little kansas girl wore around her waist the magic belt she had once captured from the
following the chariot came the scarecrow mounted on the sawhorse and the people cheered him almost as loudly as they did their lovely ruler
behind him stalked with regular jerky steps the famous machineman called tiktok who had been wound up by dorothy for the occasion
tiktok moved by clockwork and was made all of burnished copper
there followed another band after this which was called the royal court
band because the members all lived in the palace
they wore white uniforms with real diamond buttons and played what is oz without ozma very sweetly
then came professor wogglebug with a group of students from the royal
college of scientific athletics
the brilliantly polished tin woodman marched next at the head of the
royal army of oz which consisted of twentyeight officers from generals down to captains
there were no privates in the army because all were so courageous and skillful that they had been promoted one by one until there were no privates left
taken altogether the procession was a grand success and when it had returned to the palace the citizens crowded into the great throne room to see the wizard perform his tricks
the first thing the little humbug did was to produce a tiny white piglet from underneath his hat and pretend to pull it apart making two
this act he repeated until all of the nine tiny piglets were visible and they were so glad to get out of his pocket that they ran around in a very lively manner
the pretty little creatures would have been a novelty anywhere so the people were as amazed and delighted at their appearance as even the wizard could have desired
when he had made them all disappear again ozma declared she was sorry they were gone for she wanted one of them to pet and play with
afterward it was noticed that the wizard always performed his famous trick with eight piglets but it seemed to please the people just as well as if there had been nine of them
in his little room back of the throne room the wizard had found a lot of things he had left behind him when he went away in the balloon for no one had occupied the apartment in his absence
there was enough material there to enable him to prepare several new tricks which he had learned from some of the jugglers in the circus and he had passed part of the night in getting them ready
they applauded all his tricks and at the end of the performance begged him earnestly not to go away again and leave them
after the people had been dismissed with this promise our friends joined
princess ozma at an elaborate luncheon in the palace where even the
tiger and the lion were sumptuously fed and jim the cabhorse ate his oatmeal out of a golden bowl with seven rows of rubies sapphires and diamonds set around the rim of it
in the afternoon they all went to a great field outside the city gates where the games were to be held
there was a beautiful canopy for ozma and her guests to sit under and watch the people run races and jump and wrestle
you may be sure the folks of oz did their best with such a distinguished company watching them and finally zeb offered to wrestle with a little munchkin who seemed to be the champion
in appearance he was twice as old as zeb for he had long pointed whiskers and wore a peaked hat with little bells all around the brim of it which tinkled gaily as he moved
but although the munchkin was hardly tall enough to come to zebs shoulder he was so strong and clever that he laid the boy three times on his back with apparent ease
zeb was greatly astonished at his defeat and when the pretty princess joined her people in laughing at him he proposed a boxingmatch with the
munchkin to which the little ozite readily agreed
but the first time that zeb managed to give him a sharp box on the ears the munchkin sat down upon the ground and cried until the tears ran down his whiskers because he had been hurt
this made zeb laugh in turn and the boy felt comforted to find that ozma laughed as merrily at her weeping subject as she had at him
just then the scarecrow proposed a race between the sawhorse and the
cabhorse and although all the others were delighted at the suggestion the sawhorse drew back saying such a race would not be fair
of course not added jim with a touch of scorn those little wooden legs of yours are not half as long as my own
it isnt that said the sawhorse modestly but i never tire and you do
cried jim looking with great disdain at the other do you imagine for an instant that such a shabby imitation of a horse as you are can run as fast as i
i dont know im sure replied the sawhorse
that is what we are trying to find out remarked the scarecrow
the object of a race is to see who can win itor at least that is what my excellent brains think
once when i was young said jim i was a race horse and defeated all who dared run against me
i was born in kentucky you know where all the best and most aristocratic horses come from
but youre old now jim suggested zeb
why i feel like a colt today replied jim
i only wish there was a real horse here for me to race with
id show the people a fine sight i can tell you
then why not race with the sawhorse
enquired the scarecrow
hes afraid said jim
oh no answered the sawhorse
i merely said it wasnt fair
but if my friend the real horse is willing to undertake the race i am quite ready
so they unharnessed jim and took the saddle off the sawhorse and the two queerly matched animals were stood side by side for the start
when i say go
zeb called to them you must dig out and race until you reach those three trees you see over yonder
then circle round them and come back again
the first one that passes the place where the
princess sits shall be named the winner
are you ready
i suppose i ought to give the wooden dummy a good start of me growled
never mind that said the sawhorse
ill do the best i can
cried zeb and at the word the two horses leaped forward and the race was begun
illustration the wizard took a piglet from ozmas hair
jims big hoofs pounded away at a great rate and although he did not look very graceful he ran in a way to do credit to his kentucky breeding
but the sawhorse was swifter than the wind
its wooden legs moved so fast that their twinkling could scarcely be seen and although so much smaller than the cabhorse it covered the ground much faster
illustration the hungry tiger teaches jim a lesson
i am sorry to record the fact that jim was not only ashamed of his defeat but for a moment lost control of his temper
an instant later the tiger crouched and launched its huge body through the air swift and resistless as a ball from a cannon
the beast struck
jim full on his shoulder and sent the astonished cabhorse rolling over and over amid shouts of delight from the spectators who had been horrified by the ungracious act he had been guilty of
when jim came to himself and sat upon his haunches he found the cowardly
lion crouched on one side of him and the hungry tiger on the other and their eyes were glowing like balls of fire
i beg your pardon im sure said jim meekly
i was wrong to kick the sawhorse and i am sorry i became angry at him
he has won the race and won it fairly but what can a horse of flesh do against a tireless beast of wood
hearing this apology the tiger and the lion stopped lashing their tails and retreated with dignified steps to the side of the princess
no one must injure one of our friends in our presence growled the
lion and zeb ran to jim and whispered that unless he controlled his temper in the future he would probably be torn to pieces
said she my friend i reward you for your swiftness by proclaiming you prince of
horses whether of wood or of flesh and hereafter all other horsesin the land of oz at leastmust be considered imitations and you the real champion of your race
there was more applause at this and then ozma had the jewelled saddle replaced upon the sawhorse and herself rode the victor back to the city at the head of the grand procession
i ought to be a fairy grumbled jim as he slowly drew the buggy home for to be just an ordinary horse in a fairy country is to be of no account whatever
its no place for us zeb
its lucky we got here though said the boy and jim thought of the dark cave and agreed with him
illustration
the trial of eureka the kitten
i want to play with it
jellia at once departed on the errand and she was gone so long that they had almost forgotten her mission when the green robed maiden returned with a troubled face
the piglet is not there your highness said she
exclaimed ozma
are you sure
i have hunted in every part of the room the maid replied
was not the door closed
asked the princess
yes your highness i am sure it was for when i opened it dorothys white kitten crept out and ran up the stairs
hearing this dorothy and the wizard exchanged startled glances for they remembered how often eureka had longed to eat a piglet
the little girl jumped up at once
come ozma she said anxiously let us go ourselves to search for the piglet
so the two went to the dressingroom of the princess and searched carefully in every corner and among the vases and baskets and ornaments that stood about the pretty boudoir
but not a trace could they find of the tiny creature they sought
dorothy was nearly weeping by this time while ozma was angry and indignant
when they returned to the others the princess said there is little doubt that my pretty piglet has been eaten by that horrid kitten and if that is true the offender must be punished
i dont blieve eureka would do such a dreadful thing
cried dorothy much distressed
go and get my kitten please jellia and well hear what she has to say about it
the green maiden hastened away but presently returned and said the kitten will not come
she threatened to scratch my eyes out if i touched her
where is she
asked dorothy
under the bed in your own room was the reply
so dorothy ran to her room and found the kitten under the bed
come here eureka
i wont answered the kitten in a surly voice
why are you so bad
the kitten did not reply
if you dont come to me right away continued dorothy getting provoked ill take my magic belt and wish you in the country of the
why do you want me
asked eureka disturbed by this threat
you must go to princess ozma
she wants to talk to you
all right returned the kitten creeping out
im not afraid of
ozmaor anyone else
dorothy carried her in her arms back to where the others sat in grieved and thoughtful silence
tell me eureka said the princess gently did you eat my pretty piglet
i wont answer such a foolish question asserted eureka with a snarl
oh yes you will dear dorothy declared
the piglet is gone and you ran out of the room when jellia opened the door
so if you are innocent eureka you must tell the princess how you came to be in her room and what has become of the piglet
who accuses me
asked the kitten defiantly
no one answered ozma
your actions alone accuse you
the fact is that i left my little pet in my dressingroom lying asleep upon the table and you must hove stolen in without my knowing it
when next the door was opened you ran out and hid yourselfand the piglet was gone
thats none of my business growled the kitten
dont be impudent eureka admonished dorothy
it is you who are impudent said eureka for accusing me of such a crime when you cant prove it except by guessing
ozma was now greatly incensed by the kittens conduct
she summoned her
captaingeneral and when the long lean officer appeared she said carry this cat away to prison and keep her in safe confinement until she is tried by law for the crime of murder
so the captaingeneral took eureka from the arms of the now weeping
dorothy and in spite of the kittens snarls and scratches carried it away to prison
what shall we do now
asked the scarecrow with a sigh for such a crime had cast a gloom over all the company
i will summon the court to meet in the throne room at three oclock replied ozma
i myself will be the judge and the kitten shall have a fair trial
what will happen if she is guilty
asked dorothy
she must die answered the princess
nine times
enquired the scarecrow
as many times as is necessary was the reply
i will ask the tin
woodman to defend the prisoner because he has such a kind heart i am sure he will do his best to save her
and the wogglebug shall be the
public accuser because he is so learned that no one can deceive him
who will be the jury
asked the tin woodman
illustration portrait of the wizard of oz
there ought to be several animals on the jury said ozma because animals understand each other better than we people understand them
so the jury shall consist of the cowardly lion the hungry tiger jim the cabhorse the yellow hen the scarecrow the wizard tiktok the
machine man the sawhorse and zeb of hugsons ranch
that makes the nine which the law requires and all my people shall be admitted to hear the testimony
they now separated to prepare for the sad ceremony for whenever an appeal is made to law sorrow is almost certain to followeven in a fairyland like oz
the crime of murder being the most dreadful crime of all tremendous excitement prevailed in the emerald city when the news of eurekas arrest and trial became known
the wizard when he returned to his own room was exceedingly thoughtful
yet her disgrace and death would not bring back the piglet but only serve to make dorothy unhappy
so i intend to prove the kittens innocence by a trick
all the piglets are exactly alike so no one can dispute your word
this deception will save eurekas life and then we may all be happy again
i do not like to deceive my friends replied the tin woodman still my kind heart urges me to save eurekas life and i can usually trust my heart to do the right thing
so i will do as you say friend wizard
after some thought he placed the little pig inside his funnelshaped hat and then put the hat upon his head and went back to his room to think over his speech to the jury
the wizard performs another trick
at three oclock the throne room was crowded with citizens men women and children being eager to witness the great trial
princess ozma dressed in her most splendid robes of state sat in the magnificent emerald throne with her jewelled sceptre in her hand and her sparkling coronet upon her fair brow
behind her throne stood the twentyeight officers of her army and many officials of the royal household
at her right sat the queerly assorted juryanimals animated dummies and peopleall gravely prepared to listen to what was said
the kitten had been placed in a large cage just before the throne where she sat upon her haunches and gazed through the bars at the crowds around her with seeming unconcern
and now at a signal from ozma the wogglebug arose and addressed the jury
his tone was pompous and he strutted up and down in an absurd attempt to appear dignified
in either case a grave crime has been committed which deserves a grave punishment
do you mean my kitten must be put in a grave
asked dorothy
dont interrupt little girl said the wogglebug
when i get my thoughts arranged in good order i do not like to have anything upset them or throw them into confusion
if your thoughts were any good they wouldnt become confused remarked the scarecrow earnestly
my thoughts are always is this a trial of thoughts or of kittens
demanded the wogglebug
its a trial of one kitten replied the scarecrow but your manner is a trial to us all
let the public accuser continue called ozma from her throne and i pray you do not interrupt him
the criminal who now sits before the court licking her paws resumed the wogglebug has long desired to unlawfully eat the fat piglet which was no bigger than a mouse
and finally she made a wicked plan to satisfy her depraved appetite for pork
i can see her in my minds eye whats that
asked the scarecrow
i say i can see her in my minds eye the mind has no eye declared the scarecrow
your highness cried the wogglebug appealing to ozma have i a minds eye or havent i
if you have it is invisible said the princess
very true returned the wogglebug bowing
i say i see the criminal in my minds eye creeping stealthily into the room of our ozma and secreting herself when no one was looking until the princess had gone away and the door was closed
then the murderer was alone with her helpless victim the fat piglet and i see her pounce upon the innocent creature and eat it up are you still seeing with your minds eye
enquired the scarecrow
of course how else could i see it
and we know the thing is true because since the time of that interview there is no piglet to be found anywhere
illustration eureka in court
i suppose if the cat had been gone instead of the piglet your minds eye would see the piglet eating the cat suggested the scarecrow
very likely acknowledged the wogglebug
there was great applause when the speaker sat down
then the princess spoke in a stern voice prisoner what have you to say for yourself
are you guilty or not guilty
why thats for you to find out replied eureka
if you can prove im guilty ill be willing to die nine times but a minds eye is no proof because the wogglebug has no mind to see with
never mind dear said dorothy
then the tin woodman arose and said respected jury and dearly beloved ozma i pray you not to judge this feline prisoner unfeelingly
i do not think the innocent kitten can be guilty and surely it is unkind to accuse a luncheon of being a murder
eureka is the sweet pet of a lovely little girl whom we all admire and gentleness and innocence are her chief virtues
look at the kittens intelligent eyes here eureka closed her eyes sleepily gaze at her smiling countenance
here eureka snarled and showed her teeth mark the tender pose of her soft padded little hands
here eureka bared her sharp claws and scratched at the bars of the cage
would such a gentle animal be guilty of eating a fellow creature
no a thousand times no
oh cut it short said eureka youve talked long enough
im trying to defend you remonstrated the tin woodman
then say something sensible retorted the kitten
tell them it would be foolish for me to eat the piglet because i had sense enough to know it would raise a row if i did
but dont try to make out im too innocent to eat a fat piglet if i could do it and not be found out
i imagine it would taste mighty good
perhaps it would to those who eat remarked the tin woodman
i myself not being built to eat have no personal experience in such matters
but i remember that our great poet once said to eat is sweet when hungers seat demands a treat of savory meat
take this into consideration friends of the jury and you will readily decide that the kitten is wrongfully accused and should be set at liberty
when the tin woodman sat down no one applauded him for his arguments had not been very convincing and few believed that he had proved
eurekas innocence
as for the jury the members whispered to each other for a few minutes and then they appointed the hungry tiger their spokesman
the huge beast slowly arose and said kittens have no consciences so they eat whatever pleases them
the jury believes the white kitten known as eureka is guilty of having eaten the piglet owned by princess ozma and recommends that she be put to death in punishment of the crime
the judgment of the jury was received with great applause although
dorothy was sobbing miserably at the fate of her pet
the princess was just about to order eurekas head chopped off with the tin woodmans axe when that brilliant personage once more arose and addressed her
your highness said he see how easy it is for a jury to be mistaken
the kitten could not have eaten your pigletfor here it is
he took off his funnel hat and from beneath it produced a tiny white piglet which he held aloft that all might see it clearly
ozma was delighted and exclaimed eagerly give me my pet nick chopper
and all the people cheered and clapped their hands rejoicing that the prisoner had escaped death and been proved to be innocent
as the princess held the white piglet in her arms and stroked its soft hair she said let eureka out of the cage for she is no longer a prisoner but our good friend
where did you find my missing pet nick
in a room of the palace he answered
justice remarked the scarecrow with a sigh is a dangerous thing to meddle with
if you hadnt happened to find the piglet eureka would surely have been executed
but justice prevailed at the last said ozma for here is my pet and
eureka is once more free
i refuse to be free cried the kitten in a sharp voice unless the
wizard can do his trick with eight piglets
if he can produce but seven then this it not the piglet that was lost but another one
hush eureka
warned the wizard
dont be foolish advised the tin woodman or you may be sorry for it
the piglet that belonged to the princess wore an emerald collar said
eureka loudly enough for all to hear
exclaimed ozma
this cannot be the one the wizard gave me
of course not he had nine of them altogether declared eureka and
i must say it was very stingy of him not to let me eat just a few
but now that this foolish trial is ended i will tell you what really became of your pet piglet
when ozma went away she closed the door and left her pet on the table
at once i jumped up and told the piglet not to make a fuss for he would be inside of me in half a second but no one can teach one of these creatures to be reasonable
instead of keeping still so i could eat him comfortably he trembled so with fear that he fell off the table into a big vase that was standing on the floor
the vase had a very small neck and spread out at the top like a bowl
at first the piglet stuck in the neck of the vase and i thought i should get him after all but he wriggled himself through and fell down into the deep bottom partand i suppose hes there yet
all were astonished at this confession and ozma at once sent an officer to her room to fetch the vase
when he returned the princess looked down the narrow neck of the big ornament and discovered her lost piglet just as eureka had said she would
there was no way to get the creature out without breaking the vase so the tin woodman smashed it with his axe and set the little prisoner free
then the crowd cheered lustily and dorothy hugged the kitten in her arms and told her how delighted she was to know that she was innocent
but why didnt you tell us at first
it would have spoiled the fun replied the kitten yawning
ozma gave the wizard back the piglet he had so kindly allowed nick
chopper to substitute for the lost one and then she carried her own into the apartments of the palace where she lived
and now the trial being over the good citizens of the emerald city scattered to their homes well content with the days amusement
zeb returns to the ranch
eureka was much surprised to find herself in disgrace but she was in spite of the fact that she had not eaten the piglet
for the folks of oz knew the kitten had tried to commit the crime and that only an accident had prevented her from doing so therefore even the hungry tiger preferred not to associate with her
dorothy was herself anxious to get home so she promised eureka they would not stay in the land of oz much longer
the next evening after the trial the little girl begged ozma to allow her to look in the enchanted picture and the princess readily consented
she took the child to her room and said make your wish dear and the picture will show the scene you desire to behold
then dorothy found with the aid of the enchanted picture that uncle
henry had returned to the farm in kansas and she also saw that both he and aunt em were dressed in mourning because they thought their little niece had been killed by the earthquake
really said the girl anxiously i must get back as soon as possble to my own folks
zeb also wanted to see his home and although he did not find anyone mourning for him the sight of hugsons ranch in the picture made him long to get back there
this is a fine country and i like all the people that live in it he told dorothy
but the fact is jim and i dont seem to fit into a fairyland and the old horse has been begging me to go home again ever since he lost the race
so if you can find a way to fix it well be much obliged to you
ozma can do it easily replied dorothy
tomorrow morning ill go to
kansas and you can go to californy
illustration im much obliged for all your kindness
that last evening was so delightful that the boy will never forget it as long as he lives
then dorothy wound up tiktok and he danced a jig to amuse the company after which the yellow hen related some of her adventures with the nome
king in the land of ev
the princess served delicious refreshments to those who were in the habit of eating and when dorothys bed time arrived the company separated after exchanging many friendly sentiments
next morning they all assembled for the final parting and many of the officials and courtiers came to look upon the impressive ceremonies
dorothy held eureka in her arms and bade her friends a fond goodbye
you must come again some time said the little wizard and she promised she would if she found it possible to do so
but uncle henry and aunt em need me to help them she added so i cant ever be very long away from the farm in kansas
ozma wore the magic belt and when she had kissed dorothy farewell and had made her wish the little girl and her kitten disappeared in a twinkling
where is she
asked zeb rather bewildered by the suddenness of it
greeting her uncle and aunt in kansas by this time returned ozma with a smile
then zeb brought out jim all harnessed to the buggy and took his seat
im much obliged for all your kindness said the boy and very grateful to you for saving my life and sending me home again after all the good times ive had
i think this is the loveliest country in the world but not being fairies jim and i feel we ought to be where we belongand thats at the ranch
goodbye everybody
he gave a start and rubbed his eyes
jim was trotting along the wellknown road shaking his ears and whisking his tail with a contented motion
just ahead of them were the gates of hugsons ranch and uncle
hugson now came out and stood with uplifted arms and wide open mouth staring in amazement
goodness gracious
its zeband jim too
he exclaimed
where in the world have you been my lad
why in the world uncle answered zeb with a laugh
