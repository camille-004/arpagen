and he said it so crossly that she knew there was not the least use in staying another minute
she went skipping slowly down the outside walk thinking him over and saying to herself that queer as it was here was another person whom she liked in spite of his crossness
she liked old
ben weatherstaff
yes she did like him
she always wanted to try to make him talk to her
also she began to believe that he knew everything in the world about flowers
there was a laurelhedged walk which curved round the secret garden and ended at a gate which opened into a wood in the park
she thought she would skip round this walk and look into the wood and see if there were any rabbits hopping about
she enjoyed the skipping very much and when she reached the little gate she opened it and went through because she heard a low peculiar whistling sound and wanted to find out what it was
it was a very strange thing indeed
she quite caught her breath as she stopped to look at it
a boy was sitting under a tree with his back against it playing on a rough wooden pipe
he was a funny looking boy about twelve
he looked very clean and his nose turned up and his cheeks were as red as poppies and never had mistress mary seen such round and such blue eyes in any boys face
when he saw mary he held up his hand and spoke to her in a voice almost as low as and rather like his piping
dont tha move he said
itd flight em
mary remained motionless
he stopped playing his pipe and began to rise from the ground
im dickon the boy said
i know thart miss mary
then mary realized that somehow she had known at first that he was
who else could have been charming rabbits and pheasants as the natives charm snakes in india
he had a wide red curving mouth and his smile spread all over his face
i got up slow he explained because if tha makes a quick move it startles em
a body as to move gentle an speak low when wild things is about
he did not speak to her as if they had never seen each other before but as if he knew her quite well
mary knew nothing about boys and she spoke to him a little stiffly because she felt rather shy
did you get marthas letter
he nodded his curly rustcolored head
thats why i come
he stooped to pick up something which had been lying on the ground beside him when he piped
ive got th garden tools
theres a little spade an rake an a fork an hoe
they are good uns
theres a trowel too
an th woman in th shop threw in a packet o white poppy an one o blue larkspur when
i bought th other seeds
will you show the seeds to me
she wished she could talk as he did
his speech was so quick and easy
it sounded as if he liked her and was not the least afraid she would not like him though he was only a common moor boy in patched clothes and with a funny face and a rough rustyred head
as she came closer to him she noticed that there was a clean fresh scent of heather and grass and leaves about him almost as if he were made of them
she liked it very much and when she looked into his funny face with the red cheeks and round blue eyes she forgot that she had felt shy
let us sit down on this log and look at them she said
they sat down and he took a clumsy little brown paper package out of his coat pocket
he untied the string and inside there were ever so many neater and smaller packages with a picture of a flower on each one
theres a lot o mignonette an poppies he said
mignonettes th sweetest smellin thing as grows an itll grow wherever you cast it same as poppies will
them asll come up an bloom if you just whistle to em thems th nicest of all
he stopped and turned his head quickly his poppycheeked face lighting up
wheres that robin as is callin us
the chirp came from a thick holly bush bright with scarlet berries and
mary thought she knew whose it was
is it really calling us
aye said dickon as if it was the most natural thing in the world hes callin some one hes friends with
thats same as sayin here i am
look at me
i wants a bit of a chat
there he is in the bush
whose is he
hes ben weatherstaffs but i think he knows me a little answered
aye he knows thee said dickon in his low voice again
an he likes thee
hes took thee on
hell tell me all about thee in a minute
he moved quite close to the bush with the slow movement mary had noticed before and then he made a sound almost like the robins own twitter
the robin listened a few seconds intently and then answered quite as if he were replying to a question
aye hes a friend o yours chuckled dickon
do you think he is
cried mary eagerly
she did so want to know
do you think he really likes me
he wouldnt come near thee if he didnt answered dickon
birds is rare choosers an a robin can flout a body worse than a man
see hes making up to thee now
cannot tha see a chap
and it really seemed as if it must be true
he so sidled and twittered and tilted as he hopped on his bush
do you understand everything birds say
dickons grin spread until he seemed all wide red curving mouth and he rubbed his rough head
i think i do and they think i do he said
ive lived on th moor with em so long
ive watched em break shell an come out an fledge an learn to fly an begin to sing till i think im one of em
sometimes i think praps im a bird or a fox or a rabbit or a squirrel or even a beetle an i dont know it
he laughed and came back to the log and began to talk about the flower seeds again
he told her what they looked like when they were flowers he told her how to plant them and watch them and feed and water them
see here he said suddenly turning round to look at her
ill plant them for thee myself
where is tha garden
marys thin hands clutched each other as they lay on her lap
she did not know what to say so for a whole minute she said nothing
she had never thought of this
she felt miserable
and she felt as if she went red and then pale
thas got a bit o garden hasnt tha
dickon said
it was true that she had turned red and then pale
dickon saw her do it and as she still said nothing he began to be puzzled
wouldnt they give thee a bit
hasnt tha got any yet
she held her hands even tighter and turned her eyes toward him
i dont know anything about boys she said slowly
could you keep a secret if i told you one
its a great secret
i dont know what i should do if any one found it out
i believe i should die
she said the last sentence quite fiercely
dickon looked more puzzled than ever and even rubbed his hand over his rough head again but he answered quite goodhumoredly
im keepin secrets all th time he said
if i couldnt keep secrets from th other lads secrets about foxes cubs an birds nests an wild things holes thered be naught safe on th moor
aye i can keep secrets
mistress mary did not mean to put out her hand and clutch his sleeve but she did it
ive stolen a garden she said very fast
it isnt mine
it isnt anybodys
nobody wants it nobody cares for it nobody ever goes into it
perhaps everything is dead in it already i dont know
she began to feel hot and as contrary as she had ever felt in her life
i dont care i dont care
nobody has any right to take it from me when i care about it and they dont
theyre letting it die all shut in by itself she ended passionately and she threw her arms over her face and burst out cryingpoor little mistress mary
dickons curious blue eyes grew rounder and rounder
he said drawing his exclamation out slowly and the way he did it meant both wonder and sympathy
ive nothing to do said mary
nothing belongs to me
i found it myself and i got into it myself
i was only just like the robin and they wouldnt take it from the robin
where is it
asked dickon in a dropped voice
mistress mary got up from the log at once
she knew she felt contrary again and obstinate and she did not care at all
she was imperious and
indian and at the same time hot and sorrowful
come with me and ill show you she said
she led him round the laurel path and to the walk where the ivy grew so thickly
dickon followed her with a queer almost pitying look on his face
he felt as if he were being led to look at some strange birds nest and must move softly
when she stepped to the wall and lifted the hanging ivy he started
there was a door and mary pushed it slowly open and they passed in together and then mary stood and waved her hand round defiantly
its this she said
its a secret garden and im the only one in the world who wants it to be alive
dickon looked round and round about it and round and round again
he almost whispered it is a queer pretty place
its like as if a body was in a dream
chapter xi
the nest of the missel thrush
i never thought id see this place he said at last in a whisper
did you know about it
asked mary
she had spoken aloud and he made a sign to her
we must talk low he said or some onell hear us an wonder whats to do in here
said mary feeling frightened and putting her hand quickly against her mouth
did you know about the garden
she asked again when she had recovered herself
dickon nodded
martha told me there was one as no one ever went inside he answered
us used to wonder what it was like
he stopped and looked round at the lovely gray tangle about him and his round eyes looked queerly happy
the nests asll be here come springtime he said
itd be th safest nestin place in england
no one never comin near an tangles o trees an roses to build in
i wonder all th birds on th moor dont build here
mistress mary put her hand on his arm again without knowing it
will there be roses
she whispered
can you tell
i thought perhaps they were all dead
not themnot all of em
he answered
he stepped over to the nearest treean old old one with gray lichen all over its bark but upholding a curtain of tangled sprays and branches
he took a thick knife out of his pocket and opened one of its blades
theres lots o dead wood as ought to be cut out he said
an theres a lot o old wood but it made some new last year
this heres a new bit and he touched a shoot which looked brownish green instead of hard dry gray
mary touched it herself in an eager reverent way
is that one quite alivequite
dickon curved his wide smiling mouth
its as wick as you or me he said and mary remembered that martha had told her that wick meant alive or lively
im glad its wick
she cried out in her whisper
i want them all to be wick
let us go round the garden and count how many wick ones there are
she quite panted with eagerness and dickon was as eager as she was
they went from tree to tree and from bush to bush
dickon carried his knife in his hand and showed her things which she thought wonderful
theyve run wild he said but th strongest ones has fair thrived on it
the delicatest ones has died out but th others has growed an growed an spread an spread till theys a wonder
and he pulled down a thick gray drylooking branch
a body might think this was dead wood but i dont believe it isdown to th root
ill cut it low down an see
he knelt and with his knife cut the lifelesslooking branch through not far above the earth
he said exultantly
i told thee so
theres green in that wood yet
look at it
mary was down on her knees before he spoke gazing with all her might
when it looks a bit greenish an juicy like that its wick he explained
when th inside is dry an breaks easy like this here piece
ive cut off its done for
they went from bush to bush and from tree to tree
he was very strong and clever with his knife and knew how to cut the dry and dead wood away and could tell when an unpromising bough or twig had still green life in it
the spade and hoe and fork were very useful
he showed her how to use the fork while he dug about roots with the spade and stirred the earth and let the air in
they were working industriously round one of the biggest standard roses when he caught sight of something which made him utter an exclamation of surprise
he cried pointing to the grass a few feet away
who did that there
it was one of marys own little clearings round the pale green points
i did it said mary
why i thought tha didnt know nothin about gardenin he exclaimed
i dont she answered but they were so little and the grass was so thick and strong and they looked as if they had no room to breathe
i made a place for them
i dont even know what they are
dickon went and knelt down by them smiling his wide smile
tha was right he said
a gardener couldnt have told thee better
theyll grow now like jacks beanstalk
theyre crocuses an snowdrops an these here is narcissuses turning to another patch an heres daffydowndillys
they will be a sight
he ran from one clearing to another
tha has done a lot o work for such a little wench he said looking her over
im growing fatter said mary and im growing stronger
i used always to be tired
when i dig im not tired at all
i like to smell the earth when its turned up
its rare good for thee he said nodding his head wisely
theres naught as nice as th smell o good clean earth except th smell o fresh growin things when th rain falls on em
i get out on th moor many a day when its rainin an i lie under a bush an listen to th soft swish o drops on th heather an i just sniff an sniff
my nose end fair quivers like a rabbits mother says
do you never catch cold
inquired mary gazing at him wonderingly
she had never seen such a funny boy or such a nice one
not me he said grinning
i never ketched cold since i was born
i wasnt brought up nesh enough
ive chased about th moor in all weathers same as th rabbits does
mother says ive sniffed up too much fresh air for twelve year to ever get to sniffin with cold
im as tough as a whitethorn knobstick
he was working all the time he was talking and mary was following him and helping him with her fork or the trowel
theres a lot of work to do here
he said once looking about quite exultantly
will you come again and help me to do it
mary begged
im sure i can help too
i can dig and pull up weeds and do whatever you tell me
do come dickon
ill come every day if tha wants me rain or shine he answered stoutly
its th best fun i ever had in my lifeshut in here an wakenin up a garden
if you will come said mary if you will help me to make it alive
illi dont know what ill do she ended helplessly
what could you do for a boy like that
ill tell thee what thall do said dickon with his happy grin
thall get fat an thall get as hungry as a young fox an thall learn how to talk to th robin same as i do
well have a lot o fun
he began to walk about looking up in the trees and at the walls and bushes with a thoughtful expression
i wouldnt want to make it look like a gardeners garden all clipped an spick an span would you
its nicer like this with things runnin wild an swingin an catchin hold of each other
dont let us make it tidy said mary anxiously
it wouldnt seem like a secret garden if it was tidy
dickon stood rubbing his rustyred head with a rather puzzled look
its a secret garden sure enough he said but seems like some one besides th robin must have been in it since it was shut up ten year ago
but the door was locked and the key was buried said mary
no one could get in
thats true he answered
its a queer place
seems to me as if thered been a bit o prunin done here an there later than ten year ago
but how could it have been done
he was examining a branch of a standard rose and he shook his head
how could it
he murmured
with th door locked an th key buried
mistress mary always felt that however many years she lived she should never forget that first morning when her garden began to grow
of course it did seem to begin to grow for her that morning
when dickon began to clear places to plant seeds she remembered what basil had sung at her when he wanted to tease her
are there any flowers that look like bells
she inquired
lilies o th valley does he answered digging away with the trowel an theres canterbury bells an campanulas
let us plant some said mary
theres lilies o th valley here already i saw em
theyll have growed too close an well have to separate em but theres plenty
th other ones takes two years to bloom from seed but i can bring you some bits o plants from our cottage garden
why does tha want em
then mary told him about basil and his brothers and sisters in india and of how she had hated them and of their calling her mistress mary quite
they used to dance round and sing at me
they sang mistress mary quite contrary how does your garden grow
with silver bells and cockle shells and marigolds all in a row
i just remembered it and it made me wonder if there were really flowers like silver bells
she frowned a little and gave her trowel a rather spiteful dig into the earth
i wasnt as contrary as they were
but dickon laughed
mary kneeling by him holding the seeds looked at him and stopped frowning
dickon she said
you are as nice as martha said you were
i like you and you make the fifth person
i never thought i should like five people
dickon sat up on his heels as martha did when she was polishing the grate
he did look funny and delightful mary thought with his round blue eyes and red cheeks and happy looking turnedup nose
only five folk as tha likes
who is th other four
your mother and martha mary checked them off on her fingers and the robin and ben weatherstaff
dickon laughed so that he was obliged to stifle the sound by putting his arm over his mouth
i know tha thinks im a queer lad he said but i think tha art th queerest little lass i ever saw
then mary did a strange thing
she leaned forward and asked him a question she had never dreamed of asking any one before
and she tried to ask it in yorkshire because that was his language and in india a native was always pleased if you knew his speech
does tha like me
he answered heartily that i does
i likes thee wonderful an so does th robin i do believe
thats two then said mary
thats two for me
and then they began to work harder than ever and more joyfully
mary was startled and sorry when she heard the big clock in the courtyard strike the hour of her midday dinner
i shall have to go she said mournfully
and you will have to go too wont you
dickon grinned
my dinners easy to carry about with me he said
mother always lets me put a bit o somethin in my pocket
he picked up his coat from the grass and brought out of a pocket a lumpy little bundle tied up in a quiet clean coarse blue and white handkerchief
it held two thick pieces of bread with a slice of something laid between them
its oftenest naught but bread he said but ive got a fine slice o fat bacon with it today
mary thought it looked a queer dinner but he seemed ready to enjoy it
run on an get thy victuals he said
ill be done with mine first
ill get some more work done before i start back home
he sat down with his back against a tree
ill call th robin up he said and give him th rind o th bacon to peck at
they likes a bit o fat wonderful
mary could scarcely bear to leave him
suddenly it seemed as if he might be a sort of wood fairy who might be gone when she came into the garden again
he seemed too good to be true
she went slowly halfway to the door in the wall and then she stopped and went back
whatever happens youyou never would tell
his poppycolored cheeks were distended with his first big bite of bread and bacon but he managed to smile encouragingly
if tha was a missel thrush an showed me where thy nest was does tha think id tell any one
not me he said
tha art as safe as a missel thrush
and she was quite sure she was
chapter xii might i have a bit of earth
mary ran so fast that she was rather out of breath when she reached her room
her hair was ruffled on her forehead and her cheeks were bright pink
her dinner was waiting on the table and martha was waiting near it
thas a bit late she said
where has tha been
ive seen dickon
ive seen dickon
i knew hed come said martha exultantly
how does tha like him
i thinki think hes beautiful
said mary in a determined voice
martha looked rather taken aback but she looked pleased too
well she said hes th best lad as ever was born but us never thought he was handsome
his nose turns up too much
i like it to turn up said mary
an his eyes is so round said martha a trifle doubtful
though theyre a nice color
i like them round said mary
and they are exactly the color of the sky over the moor
martha beamed with satisfaction
mother says he made em that color with always lookin up at th birds an th clouds
but he has got a big mouth hasnt he now
i love his big mouth said mary obstinately
i wish mine were just like it
martha chuckled delightedly
itd look rare an funny in thy bit of a face she said
but i knowed it would be that way when tha saw him
how did tha like th seeds an th garden tools
how did you know he brought them
asked mary
i never thought of him not bringin em
hed be sure to bring em if they was in yorkshire
hes such a trusty lad
mary was afraid that she might begin to ask difficult questions but she did not
she was very much interested in the seeds and gardening tools and there was only one moment when mary was frightened
this was when she began to ask where the flowers were to be planted
who did tha ask about it
she inquired
i havent asked anybody yet said mary hesitating
well i wouldnt ask th head gardener
hes too grand mr
ive never seen him said mary
ive only seen undergardeners and
ben weatherstaff
if i was you id ask ben weatherstaff advised martha
hes not half as bad as he looks for all hes so crabbed
craven lets him do what he likes because he was here when mrs
craven was alive an he used to make her laugh
she liked him
perhaps hed find you a corner somewhere out o the way
if it was out of the way and no one wanted it no one could mind my having it could they
mary said anxiously
there wouldnt be no reason answered martha
you wouldnt do no harm
mary ate her dinner as quickly as she could and when she rose from the table she was going to run to her room to put on her hat again but
martha stopped her
ive got somethin to tell you she said
i thought id let you eat your dinner first
craven came back this mornin and i think he wants to see you
mary turned quite pale
he didnt want to see me when i came
pitcher say he didnt
well explained martha mrs
medlock says its because o mother
she was walkin to thwaite village an she met him
shed never spoke to him before but mrs
craven had been to our cottage two or three times
hed forgot but mother hadnt an she made bold to stop him
i dont know what she said to him about you but she said somethin as put him in th mind to see you before he goes away again tomorrow
cried mary is he going away tomorrow
i am so glad
hes goin for a long time
he maynt come back till autumn or winter
hes goin to travel in foreign places
hes always doin it
im so gladso glad
said mary thankfully
if he did not come back until winter or even autumn there would be time to watch the secret garden come alive
even if he found out then and took it away from her she would have had that much at least
when do you think he will want to see
she did not finish the sentence because the door opened and mrs
medlock walked in
she had on her best black dress and cap and her collar was fastened with a large brooch with a picture of a mans face on it
it was a colored photograph of mr
medlock who had died years ago and she always wore it when she was dressed up
she looked nervous and excited
your hairs rough she said quickly
go and brush it
martha help her to slip on her best dress
craven sent me to bring her to him in his study
all the pink left marys cheeks
her heart began to thump and she felt herself changing into a stiff plain silent child again
she did not even answer mrs
medlock but turned and walked into her bedroom followed by martha
she said nothing while her dress was changed and her hair brushed and after she was quite tidy she followed mrs
medlock down the corridors in silence
what was there for her to say
she was obliged to go and see mr
craven and he would not like her and she would not like him
she knew what he would think of her
she was taken to a part of the house she had not been into before
at last mrs
medlock knocked at a door and when some one said come in they entered the room together
a man was sitting in an armchair before the fire and mrs
medlock spoke to him
this is miss mary sir she said
you can go and leave her here
i will ring for you when i want you to take her away said mr
when she went out and closed the door mary could only stand waiting a plain little thing twisting her thin hands together
she could see that the man in the chair was not so much a hunchback as a man with high rather crooked shoulders and he had black hair streaked with white
he turned his head over his high shoulders and spoke to her
mary went to him
he was not ugly
his face would have been handsome if it had not been so miserable
he looked as if the sight of her worried and fretted him and as if he did not know what in the world to do with her
are you well
yes answered mary
do they take good care of you
he rubbed his forehead fretfully as he looked her over
you are very thin he said
i am getting fatter mary answered in what she knew was her stiffest way
what an unhappy face he had
his black eyes seemed as if they scarcely saw her as if they were seeing something else and he could hardly keep his thoughts upon her
i forgot you he said
how could i remember you
i intended to send you a governess or a nurse or some one of that sort but i forgot
please began mary
please and then the lump in her throat choked her
what do you want to say
he inquired
i ami am too big for a nurse said mary
and pleaseplease dont make me have a governess yet
he rubbed his forehead again and stared at her
that was what the sowerby woman said he muttered absentmindedly
then mary gathered a scrap of courage
is sheis she marthas mother
she stammered
yes i think so he replied
she knows about children said mary
she has twelve
he seemed to rouse himself
what do you want to do
i want to play out of doors mary answered hoping that her voice did not tremble
i never liked it in india
it makes me hungry here and i am getting fatter
he was watching her
sowerby said it would do you good
perhaps it will he said
she thought you had better get stronger before you had a governess
it makes me feel strong when i play and the wind comes over the moor argued mary
where do you play
he asked next
everywhere gasped mary
marthas mother sent me a skippingrope
i skip and runand i look about to see if things are beginning to stick up out of the earth
i dont do any harm
dont look so frightened he said in a worried voice
you could not do any harm a child like you
you may do what you like
mary put her hand up to her throat because she was afraid he might see the excited lump which she felt jump into it
she came a step nearer to him
she said tremulously
her anxious little face seemed to worry him more than ever
dont look so frightened he exclaimed
of course you may
i am your guardian though i am a poor one for any child
i cannot give you time or attention
i am too ill and wretched and distracted but i wish you to be happy and comfortable
i dont know anything about children but
medlock is to see that you have all you need
i sent for you today because mrs
sowerby said i ought to see you
her daughter had talked about you
she thought you needed fresh air and freedom and running about
she knows all about children mary said again in spite of herself
she ought to said mr
i thought her rather bold to stop me on the moor but she saidmrs
craven had been kind to her
it seemed hard for him to speak his dead wifes name
she is a respectable woman
now i have seen you i think she said sensible things
play out of doors as much as you like
its a big place and you may go where you like and amuse yourself as you like
is there anything you want
as if a sudden thought had struck him
do you want toys books dolls
might i quavered mary might i have a bit of earth
in her eagerness she did not realize how queer the words would sound and that they were not the ones she had meant to say
craven looked quite startled
he repeated
what do you mean
to plant seeds into make things growto see them come alive mary faltered
he gazed at her a moment and then passed his hand quickly over his eyes
do youcare about gardens so much he said slowly
i didnt know about them in india said mary
i was always ill and tired and it was too hot
i sometimes made little beds in the sand and stuck flowers in them
but here it is different
craven got up and began to walk slowly across the room
a bit of earth he said to himself and mary thought that somehow she must have reminded him of something
when he stopped and spoke to her his dark eyes looked almost soft and kind
you can have as much earth as you want he said
you remind me of some one else who loved the earth and things that grow
when you see a bit of earth you want with something like a smile take it child and make it come alive
may i take it from anywhereif its not wanted
anywhere he answered
you must go now i am tired
he touched the bell to call mrs
i shall be away all summer
medlock came so quickly that mary thought she must have been waiting in the corridor
medlock mr
craven said to her now i have seen the child i understand what mrs
sowerby meant
she must be less delicate before she begins lessons
give her simple healthy food
let her run wild in the garden
dont look after her too much
she needs liberty and fresh air and romping about
sowerby is to come and see her now and then and she may sometimes go to the cottage
medlock looked pleased
she was relieved to hear that she need not look after mary too much
she had felt her a tiresome charge and had indeed seen as little of her as she dared
in addition to this she was fond of marthas mother
thank you sir she said
susan sowerby and me went to school together and shes as sensible and goodhearted a woman as youd find in a days walk
i never had any children myself and shes had twelve and there never was healthier or better ones
miss mary can get no harm from them
id always take susan sowerbys advice about children myself
shes what you might call healthymindedif you understand me
i understand mr
craven answered
take miss mary away now and send
pitcher to me
medlock left her at the end of her own corridor mary flew back to her room
she found martha waiting there
martha had in fact hurried back after she had removed the dinner service
i can have my garden
cried mary
i may have it where i like
i am not going to have a governess for a long time
your mother is coming to see me and i may go to your cottage
he says a little girl like me could not do any harm and i may do what i likeanywhere
said martha delightedly that was nice of him wasnt it
martha said mary solemnly he is really a nice man only his face is so miserable and his forehead is all drawn together
she ran as quickly as she could to the garden
she had been away so much longer than she had thought she should and she knew dickon would have to set out early on his fivemile walk
when she slipped through the door under the ivy she saw he was not working where she had left him
the gardening tools were laid together under a tree
she ran to them looking all round the place but there was no dickon to be seen
he had gone away and the secret garden was emptyexcept for the robin who had just flown across the wall and sat on a standard rosebush watching her
hes gone she said wofully
was hewas hewas he only a wood fairy
something white fastened to the standard rosebush caught her eye
it was a piece of paperin fact it was a piece of the letter she had printed for martha to send to dickon
it was fastened on the bush with a long thorn and in a minute she knew dickon had left it there
there were some roughly printed letters on it and a sort of picture
at first she could not tell what it was
then she saw it was meant for a nest with a bird sitting on it
underneath were the printed letters and they said i will cum bak
chapter xiii i am colin
mary took the picture back to the house when she went to her supper and she showed it to martha
said martha with great pride
i never knew our dickon was as clever as that
that theres a picture of a missel thrush on her nest as large as life an twice as natural
then mary knew dickon had meant the picture to be a message
he had meant that she might be sure he would keep her secret
her garden was her nest and she was like a missel thrush
oh how she did like that queer common boy
she hoped he would come back the very next day and she fell asleep looking forward to the morning
but you never know what the weather will do in yorkshire particularly in the springtime
she was awakened in the night by the sound of rain beating with heavy drops against her window
it was pouring down in torrents and the wind was wuthering round the corners and in the chimneys of the huge old house
mary sat up in bed and felt miserable and angry
the rain is as contrary as i ever was she said
it came because it knew i did not want it
she threw herself back on her pillow and buried her face
she did not cry but she lay and hated the sound of the heavily beating rain she hated the wind and its wuthering
she could not go to sleep again
the mournful sound kept her awake because she felt mournful herself
if she had felt happy it would probably have lulled her to sleep
how it wuthered and how the big raindrops poured down and beat against the pane
it sounds just like a person lost on the moor and wandering on and on crying she said
she had been lying awake turning from side to side for about an hour when suddenly something made her sit up in bed and turn her head toward the door listening
she listened and she listened
it isnt the wind now she said in a loud whisper
that isnt the wind
it is different
it is that crying i heard before
the door of her room was ajar and the sound came down the corridor a faroff faint sound of fretful crying
she listened for a few minutes and each minute she became more and more sure
she felt as if she must find out what it was
it seemed even stranger than the secret garden and the buried key
perhaps the fact that she was in a rebellious mood made her bold
she put her foot out of bed and stood on the floor
i am going to find out what it is she said
everybody is in bed and
i dont care about mrs
medlocki dont care
there was a candle by her bedside and she took it up and went softly out of the room
the corridor looked very long and dark but she was too excited to mind that
she thought she remembered the corners she must turn to find the short corridor with the door covered with tapestrythe one mrs
medlock had come through the day she lost herself
the sound had come up that passage
so she went on with her dim light almost feeling her way her heart beating so loud that she fancied she could hear it
the faroff faint crying went on and led her
sometimes it stopped for a moment or so and then began again
was this the right corner to turn
she stopped and thought
yes it was
down this passage and then to the left and then up two broad steps and then to the right again
yes there was the tapestry door
she pushed it open very gently and closed it behind her and she stood in the corridor and could hear the crying quite plainly though it was not loud
it was on the other side of the wall at her left and a few yards farther on there was a door
she could see a glimmer of light coming from beneath it
the someone was crying in that room and it was quite a young someone
so she walked to the door and pushed it open and there she was standing in the room
it was a big room with ancient handsome furniture in it
there was a low fire glowing faintly on the hearth and a night light burning by the side of a carved fourposted bed hung with brocade and on the bed was lying a boy crying fretfully
mary wondered if she was in a real place or if she had fallen asleep again and was dreaming without knowing it
the boy had a sharp delicate face the color of ivory and he seemed to have eyes too big for it
he had also a lot of hair which tumbled over his forehead in heavy locks and made his thin face seem smaller
he looked like a boy who had been ill but he was crying more as if he were tired and cross than as if he were in pain
mary stood near the door with her candle in her hand holding her breath
illustration who are you
are you a ghost
page who are you
he said at last in a halffrightened whisper
are you a ghost
no i am not mary answered her own whisper sounding half frightened
are you one
he stared and stared and stared
mary could not help noticing what strange eyes he had
they were agate gray and they looked too big for his face because they had black lashes all round them
no he replied after waiting a moment or so
i am colin
who is colin
she faltered
i am colin craven
who are you
i am mary lennox
craven is my uncle
he is my father said the boy
your father
gasped mary
no one ever told me he had a boy
why didnt they
come here he said still keeping his strange eyes fixed on her with an anxious expression
she came close to the bed and he put out his hand and touched her
you are real arent you
i have such real dreams very often
you might be one of them
mary had slipped on a woolen wrapper before she left her room and she put a piece of it between his fingers
rub that and see how thick and warm it is she said
i will pinch you a little if you like to show you how real i am
for a minute i thought you might be a dream too
where did you come from
from my own room
the wind wuthered so i couldnt go to sleep and i heard some one crying and wanted to find out who it was
what were you crying for
because i couldnt go to sleep either and my head ached
tell me your name again
mary lennox
did no one ever tell you i had come to live here
he was still fingering the fold of her wrapper but he began to look a little more as if he believed in her reality
no he answered
they darent
asked mary
because i should have been afraid you would see me
i wont let people see me and talk me over
mary asked again feeling more mystified every moment
because i am like this always ill and having to lie down
my father wont let people talk me over either
the servants are not allowed to speak about me
if i live i may be a hunchback but i shant live
my father hates to think i may be like him
oh what a queer house this is
what a queer house
everything is a kind of secret
rooms are locked up and gardens are locked upand you
have you been locked up
i stay in this room because i dont want to be moved out of it
it tires me too much
does your father come and see you
mary ventured
generally when i am asleep
he doesnt want to see me
mary could not help asking again
a sort of angry shadow passed over the boys face
my mother died when i was born and it makes him wretched to look at me
he thinks i dont know but ive heard people talking
he almost hates me
he hates the garden because she died said mary half speaking to herself
what garden
the boy asked
justjust a garden she used to like mary stammered
have you been here always
nearly always
sometimes i have been taken to places at the seaside but i wont stay because people stare at me
i used to wear an iron thing to keep my back straight but a grand doctor came from london to see me and said it was stupid
he told them to take it off and keep me out in the fresh air
i hate fresh air and i dont want to go out
i didnt when first i came here said mary
why do you keep looking at me like that
because of the dreams that are so real he answered rather fretfully
sometimes when i open my eyes i dont believe im awake
were both awake said mary
she glanced round the room with its high ceiling and shadowy corners and dim firelight
it looks quite like a dream and its the middle of the night and everybody in the house is asleepeverybody but us
we are wide awake
i dont want it to be a dream the boy said restlessly
mary thought of something all at once
if you dont like people to see you she began do you want me to go away
he still held the fold of her wrapper and he gave it a little pull
no he said
i should be sure you were a dream if you went
if you are real sit down on that big footstool and talk
i want to hear about you
mary put down her candle on the table near the bed and sat down on the cushioned stool
she did not want to go away at all
she wanted to stay in the mysterious hiddenaway room and talk to the mysterious boy
what do you want me to tell you
she answered all these questions and many more and he lay back on his pillow and listened
he made her tell him a great deal about india and about her voyage across the ocean
she found out that because he had been an invalid he had not learned things as other children had
one of his nurses had taught him to read when he was quite little and he was always reading and looking at pictures in splendid books
though his father rarely saw him when he was awake he was given all sorts of wonderful things to amuse himself with
he never seemed to have been amused however
he could have anything he asked for and was never made to do anything he did not like to do
every one is obliged to do what pleases me he said indifferently
it makes me ill to be angry
no one believes i shall live to grow up
he said it as if he was so accustomed to the idea that it had ceased to matter to him at all
he seemed to like the sound of marys voice
as she went on talking he listened in a drowsy interested way
once or twice she wondered if he were not gradually falling into a doze
but at last he asked a question which opened up a new subject
how old are you
i am ten answered mary forgetting herself for the moment and so are you
how do you know that
he demanded in a surprised voice
because when you were born the garden door was locked and the key was buried
and it has been locked for ten years
colin half sat up turning toward her leaning on his elbows
what garden door was locked
who did it
where was the key buried
he exclaimed as if he were suddenly very much interested
itit was the garden mr
craven hates said mary nervously
he locked the door
no oneno one knew where he buried the key
what sort of a garden is it
colin persisted eagerly
no one has been allowed to go into it for ten years was marys careful answer
but it was too late to be careful
he was too much like herself
he too had had nothing to think about and the idea of a hidden garden attracted him as it had attracted her
he asked question after question
where was it
had she never looked for the door
had she never asked the gardeners
they wont talk about it said mary
i think they have been told not to answer questions
i would make them said colin
mary faltered beginning to feel frightened
if he could make people answer questions who knew what might happen
every one is obliged to please me
i told you that he said
if i were to live this place would sometime belong to me
they all know that
i would make them tell me
mary had not known that she herself had been spoiled but she could see quite plainly that this mysterious boy had been
he thought that the whole world belonged to him
how peculiar he was and how coolly he spoke of not living
do you think you wont live
she asked partly because she was curious and partly in hope of making him forget the garden
i dont suppose i shall he answered as indifferently as he had spoken before
ever since i remember anything i have heard people say i shant
at first they thought i was too little to understand and now they think i dont hear
my doctor is my fathers cousin
he is quite poor and if i die he will have all misselthwaite when my father is dead
i should think he wouldnt want me to live
do you want to live
inquired mary
no he answered in a cross tired fashion
but i dont want to die
when i feel ill i lie here and think about it until i cry and cry
i have heard you crying three times mary said but i did not know who it was
were you crying about that
she did so want him to forget the garden
i dare say he answered
let us talk about something else
talk about that garden
dont you want to see it
yes answered mary in quite a low voice
i do he went on persistently
i dont think i ever really wanted to see anything before but i want to see that garden
i want the key dug up
i want the door unlocked
i would let them take me there in my chair
that would be getting fresh air
i am going to make them open the door
he had become quite excited and his strange eyes began to shine like stars and looked more immense than ever
they have to please me he said
i will make them take me there and i will let you go too
marys hands clutched each other
everything would be spoiledeverything
dickon would never come back
she would never again feel like a missel thrush with a safehidden nest
oh dontdontdontdont do that
she cried out
he stared as if he thought she had gone crazy
he exclaimed
you said you wanted to see it
i do she answered almost with a sob in her throat but if you make them open the door and take you in like that it will never be a secret again
he leaned still farther forward
a secret he said
what do you mean
marys words almost tumbled over one another
he interrupted her
it soon will be if no one cares for it she went on
the bulbs will live but the roses
he stopped her again as excited as she was herself
what are bulbs
he put in quickly
they are daffodils and lilies and snowdrops
they are working in the earth nowpushing up pale green points because the spring is coming
is the spring coming
what is it like
you dont see it in rooms if you are ill
it is the sun shining on the rain and the rain falling on the sunshine and things pushing up and working under the earth said mary
if the garden was a secret and we could get into it we could watch the things grow bigger every day and see how many roses are alive
dont you see
oh dont you see how much nicer it would be if it was a secret
he dropped back on his pillow and lay there with an odd expression on his face
i never had a secret he said except that one about not living to grow up
they dont know i know that so it is a sort of secret
but i like this kind better
if you wont make them take you to the garden pleaded mary perhapsi feel almost sure i can find out how to get in sometime
i shouldlikethat he said very slowly his eyes looking dreamy
i should like that
i should not mind fresh air in a secret garden
mary began to recover her breath and feel safer because the idea of keeping the secret seemed to please him
ill tell you what i think it would be like if we could go into it she said
it has been shut up so long things have grown into a tangle perhaps
and then she told him about the robin and ben
weatherstaff and there was so much to tell about the robin and it was so easy and safe to talk about it that she ceased to feel afraid
the robin pleased him so much that he smiled until he looked almost beautiful and at first mary had thought that he was even plainer than herself with his big eyes and heavy locks of hair
i did not know birds could be like that he said
but if you stay in a room you never see things
what a lot of things you know
i feel as if you had been inside that garden
she did not know what to say so she did not say anything
he evidently did not expect an answer and the next moment he gave her a surprise
i am going to let you look at something he said
do you see that rosecolored silk curtain hanging on the wall over the mantelpiece
mary had not noticed it before but she looked up and saw it
it was a curtain of soft silk hanging over what seemed to be some picture
yes she answered
there is a cord hanging from it said colin
go and pull it
mary got up much mystified and found the cord
when she pulled it the silk curtain ran back on rings and when it ran back it uncovered a picture
it was the picture of a girl with a laughing face
she is my mother said colin complainingly
i dont see why she died
sometimes i hate her for doing it
if she had lived i believe i should not have been ill always he grumbled
i dare say i should have lived too
and my father would not have hated to look at me
i dare say i should have had a strong back
draw the curtain again
mary did as she was told and returned to her footstool
she is much prettier than you she said but her eyes are just like yoursat least they are the same shape and color
why is the curtain drawn over her
he moved uncomfortably
i made them do it he said
sometimes i dont like to see her looking at me
she smiles too much when i am ill and miserable
besides she is mine and i dont want every one to see her
there were a few moments of silence and then mary spoke
what would mrs
medlock do if she found out that i had been here
she inquired
she would do as i told her to do he answered
and i should tell her that i wanted you to come here and talk to me every day
i am glad you came
so am i said mary
i will come as often as i can butshe hesitatedi shall have to look every day for the garden door
yes you must said colin and you can tell me about it afterward
he lay thinking a few minutes as he had done before and then he spoke again
i think you shall be a secret too he said
i will not tell them until they find out
i can always send the nurse out of the room and say that i want to be by myself
do you know martha
yes i know her very well said mary
she waits on me
he nodded his head toward the outer corridor
she is the one who is asleep in the other room
the nurse went away yesterday to stay all night with her sister and she always makes martha attend to me when she wants to go out
martha shall tell you when to come here
then mary understood marthas troubled look when she had asked questions about the crying
martha knew about you all the time
yes she often attends to me
the nurse likes to get away from me and then martha comes
i have been here a long time said mary
shall i go away now
your eyes look sleepy
i wish i could go to sleep before you leave me he said rather shyly
shut your eyes said mary drawing her footstool closer and i will do what my ayah used to do in india
i will pat your hand and stroke it and sing something quite low
i should like that perhaps he said drowsily
somehow she was sorry for him and did not want him to lie awake so she leaned against the bed and began to stroke and pat his hand and sing a very low little chanting song in hindustani
so she got up softly took her candle and crept away without making a sound
chapter xiv
a young rajah
the moor was hidden in mist when the morning came and the rain had not stopped pouring down
there could be no going out of doors
martha was so busy that mary had no opportunity of talking to her but in the afternoon she asked her to come and sit with her in the nursery
she came bringing the stocking she was always knitting when she was doing nothing else
whats the matter with thee
she asked as soon as they sat down
tha looks as if thad somethin to say
i have found out what the crying was said mary
martha let her knitting drop on her knee and gazed at her with startled eyes
she exclaimed
i heard it in the night mary went on
and i got up and went to see where it came from
it was colin
i found him
marthas face became red with fright
she said half crying
tha shouldnt have done ittha shouldnt
thall get me in trouble
i never told thee nothin about himbut thall get me in trouble
i shall lose my place and whatll mother do
you wont lose your place said mary
he was glad i came
we talked and talked and he said he was glad i came
cried martha
art tha sure
tha doesnt know what hes like when anything vexes him
hes a big lad to cry like a baby but when hes in a passion hell fair scream just to frighten us
he knows us darent call our souls our own
he wasnt vexed said mary
i asked him if i should go away and he made me stay
he asked me questions and i sat on a big footstool and talked to him about india and about the robin and gardens
he wouldnt let me go
he let me see his mothers picture
before i left him i sang him to sleep
martha fairly gasped with amazement
i can scarcely believe thee
she protested
its as if thad walked straight into a lions den
if hed been like he is most times hed have throwed himself into one of his tantrums and roused th house
he wont let strangers look at him
he let me look at him
i looked at him all the time and he looked at me
i dont know what to do
cried agitated martha
medlock finds out shell think i broke orders and told thee and i shall be packed back to mother
he is not going to tell mrs
medlock anything about it yet
its to be a sort of secret just at first said mary firmly
and he says everybody is obliged to do as he pleases
aye thats true enoughth bad lad
sighed martha wiping her forehead with her apron
he says mrs
medlock must
and he wants me to come and talk to him every day
and you are to tell me when he wants me
said martha i shall lose my placei shall for sure
you cant if you are doing what he wants you to do and everybody is ordered to obey him mary argued
does tha mean to say cried martha with wide open eyes that he was nice to thee
i think he almost liked me mary answered
then tha must have bewitched him
decided martha drawing a long breath
do you mean magic
inquired mary
ive heard about magic in india but i cant make it
i just went into his room and i was so surprised to see him i stood and stared
and then he turned round and stared at me
and he thought i was a ghost or a dream and i thought perhaps he was
and it was so queer being there alone together in the middle of the night and not knowing about each other
and we began to ask each other questions
and when i asked him if i must go away he said i must not
th worlds comin to a end
gasped martha
what is the matter with him
asked mary
nobody knows for sure and certain said martha
craven went off his head like when he was born
th doctors thought hed have to be put in a sylum
it was because mrs
craven died like i told you
he wouldnt set eyes on th baby
he just raved and said itd be another hunchback like him and itd better die
is colin a hunchback
mary asked
he didnt look like one
he isnt yet said martha
but he began all wrong
mother said that there was enough trouble and raging in th house to set any child wrong
they was afraid his back was weak an theyve always been takin care of itkeepin him lyin down and not lettin him walk
once they made him wear a brace but he fretted so he was downright ill
then a big doctor came to see him an made them take it off
he talked to th other doctor quite roughin a polite way
he said thered been too much medicine and too much lettin him have his own way
i think hes a very spoiled boy said mary
hes th worst young nowt as ever was
said martha
i wont say as he hasnt been ill a good bit
hes had coughs an colds thats nearly killed him two or three times
once he had rheumatic fever an once he had typhoid
medlock did get a fright then
hed been out of his head an she was talkin to th nurse thinkin he didnt know nothin an she said hell die this time sure enough an best thing for him an for everybody
an she looked at him an there he was with his big eyes open starin at her as sensible as she was herself
she didnt know whatd happen but he just stared at her an says you give me some water an stop talkin
do you think he will die
asked mary
mother says theres no reason why any child should live that gets no fresh air an doesnt do nothin but lie on his back an read picturebooks an take medicine
hes weak and hates th trouble o bein taken out o doors an he gets cold so easy he says it makes him ill
mary sat and looked at the fire
i wonder she said slowly if it would not do him good to go out into a garden and watch things growing
it did me good
one of th worst fits he ever had said martha was one time they took him out where the roses is by the fountain
hed been readin in a paper about people gettin somethin he called rose cold an he began to sneeze an said hed got it an then a new gardener as didnt know th rules passed by an looked at him curious
he threw himself into a passion an he said hed looked at him because he was going to be a hunchback
he cried himself into a fever an was ill all night
if he ever gets angry at me ill never go and see him again said
hell have thee if he wants thee said martha
tha may as well know that at th start
very soon afterward a bell rang and she rolled up her knitting
i dare say th nurse wants me to stay with him a bit she said
i hope hes in a good temper
she was out of the room about ten minutes and then she came back with a puzzled expression
well tha has bewitched him she said
hes up on his sofa with his picturebooks
hes told the nurse to stay away until six oclock
im to wait in the next room
th minute she was gone he called me to him an says i want mary lennox to come and talk to me and remember youre not to tell any one
youd better go as quick as you can
mary was quite willing to go quickly
she did not want to see colin as much as she wanted to see dickon but she wanted to see him very much
there was a bright fire on the hearth when she entered his room and in the daylight she saw it was a very beautiful room indeed
there were rich colors in the rugs and hangings and pictures and books on the walls which made it look glowing and comfortable even in spite of the gray sky and falling rain
colin looked rather like a picture himself
he was wrapped in a velvet dressinggown and sat against a big brocaded cushion
he had a red spot on each cheek
come in he said
ive been thinking about you all morning
ive been thinking about you too answered mary
you dont know how frightened martha is
she says mrs
medlock will think she told me about you and then she will be sent away
he frowned
go and tell her to come here he said
she is in the next room
mary went and brought her back
poor martha was shaking in her shoes
colin was still frowning
have you to do what i please or have you not
he demanded
i have to do what you please sir martha faltered turning quite red
has medlock to do what i please
everybody has sir said martha
well then if i order you to bring miss mary to me how can medlock send you away if she finds it out
please dont let her sir pleaded martha
ill send her away if she dares to say a word about such a thing said master craven grandly
she wouldnt like that i can tell you
thank you sir bobbing a curtsy i want to do my duty sir
what i want is your duty said colin more grandly still
ill take care of you
now go away
when the door closed behind martha colin found mistress mary gazing at him as if he had set her wondering
why do you look at me like that
he asked her
what are you thinking about
i am thinking about two things
what are they
sit down and tell me
this is the first one said mary seating herself on the big stool
once in india i saw a boy who was a rajah
he had rubies and emeralds and diamonds stuck all over him
he spoke to his people just as you spoke to martha
everybody had to do everything he told themin a minute
i think they would have been killed if they hadnt
i shall make you tell me about rajahs presently he said but first tell me what the second thing was
i was thinking said mary how different you are from dickon
who is dickon
what a queer name
she might as well tell him she thought
she could talk about dickon without mentioning the secret garden
she had liked to hear martha talk about him
besides she longed to talk about him
it would seem to bring him nearer
he is marthas brother
he is twelve years old she explained
he is not like any one else in the world
he can charm foxes and squirrels and birds just as the natives in india charm snakes
he plays a very soft tune on a pipe and they come and listen
there were some big books on a table at his side and he dragged one suddenly toward him
there is a picture of a snakecharmer in this he exclaimed
come and look at it
the book was a beautiful one with superb colored illustrations and he turned to one of them
can he do that
he asked eagerly
he played on his pipe and they listened mary explained
but he doesnt call it magic
he says its because he lives on the moor so much and he knows their ways
he says he feels sometimes as if he was a bird or a rabbit himself he likes them so
i think he asked the robin questions
it seemed as if they talked to each other in soft chirps
colin lay back on his cushion and his eyes grew larger and larger and the spots on his cheeks burned
tell me some more about him he said
he knows all about eggs and nests mary went on
and he knows where foxes and badgers and otters live
he keeps them secret so that other boys wont find their holes and frighten them
he knows about everything that grows or lives on the moor
does he like the moor
said colin
how can he when its such a great bare dreary place
its the most beautiful place protested mary
thousands of lovely things grow on it and there are thousands of little creatures all busy building nests and making holes and burrows and chippering or singing or squeaking to each other
they are so busy and having such fun under the earth or in the trees or heather
its their world
how do you know all that
said colin turning on his elbow to look at her
i have never been there once really said mary suddenly remembering
i only drove over it in the dark
i thought it was hideous
martha told me about it first and then dickon
you never see anything if you are ill said colin restlessly
he looked like a person listening to a new sound in the distance and wondering what it was
you cant if you stay in a room said mary
i couldnt go on the moor he said in a resentful tone
mary was silent for a minute and then she said something bold
you mightsometime
he moved as if he were startled
go on the moor
how could i
i am going to die
how do you know
said mary unsympathetically
she didnt like the way he had of talking about dying
she did not feel very sympathetic
she felt rather as if he almost boasted about it
oh ive heard it ever since i remember he answered crossly
they are always whispering about it and thinking i dont notice
they wish i would too
mistress mary felt quite contrary
she pinched her lips together
if they wished i would she said i wouldnt
who wishes you would
the servantsand of course dr
craven because he would get
misselthwaite and be rich instead of poor
he darent say so but he always looks cheerful when i am worse
when i had typhoid fever his face got quite fat
i think my father wishes it too
i dont believe he does said mary quite obstinately
that made colin turn and look at her again
and then he lay back on his cushion and was still as if he were thinking
and there was quite a long silence
perhaps they were both of them thinking strange things children do not usually think of
i like the grand doctor from london because he made them take the iron thing off said mary at last
did he say you were going to die
what did he say
he didnt whisper colin answered
perhaps he knew i hated whispering
i heard him say one thing quite aloud
he said the lad might live if he would make up his mind to it
put him in the humor
it sounded as if he was in a temper
ill tell you who would put you in the humor perhaps said mary reflecting
she felt as if she would like this thing to be settled one way or the other
i believe dickon would
hes always talking about live things
he never talks about dead things or things that are ill
hes always looking up in the sky to watch birds flyingor looking down at the earth to see something growing
he has such round blue eyes and they are so wide open with looking about
and he laughs such a big laugh with his wide mouthand his cheeks are as redas red as cherries
she pulled her stool nearer to the sofa and her expression quite changed at the remembrance of the wide curving mouth and wide open eyes
see here she said
dont let us talk about dying i dont like it
let us talk about living
let us talk and talk about dickon
and then we will look at your pictures
it was the best thing she could have said
and about dickons motherand the skippingropeand the moor with the sun on itand about pale green points sticking up out of the black sod
and it was all so alive that
mary talked more than she had ever talked beforeand colin both talked and listened as he had never done either before
and they both began to laugh over nothings as children will when they are happy together
they enjoyed themselves so much that they forgot the pictures and they forgot about the time
they had been laughing quite loudly over ben
weatherstaff and his robin and colin was actually sitting up as if he had forgotten about his weak back when he suddenly remembered something
do you know there is one thing we have never once thought of he said
we are cousins
it seemed so queer that they had talked so much and never remembered this simple thing that they laughed more than ever because they had got into the humor to laugh at anything
and in the midst of the fun the door opened and in walked dr
craven and mrs
craven started in actual alarm and mrs
medlock almost fell back because he had accidentally bumped against her
exclaimed poor mrs
medlock with her eyes almost starting out of her head
what is this
craven coming forward
what does it mean
then mary was reminded of the boy rajah again
colin answered as if neither the doctors alarm nor mrs
medlocks terror were of the slightest consequence
he was as little disturbed or frightened as if an elderly cat and dog had walked into the room
this is my cousin mary lennox he said
i asked her to come and talk to me
i like her
she must come and talk to me whenever i send for her
craven turned reproachfully to mrs
oh sir she panted
i dont know how its happened
theres not a servant on the place thatd dare to talkthey all have their orders
nobody told her anything said colin she heard me crying and found me herself
i am glad she came
dont be silly medlock
mary saw that dr
craven did not look pleased but it was quite plain that he dare not oppose his patient
he sat down by colin and felt his pulse
i am afraid there has been too much excitement
excitement is not good for you my boy he said
i should be excited if she kept away answered colin his eyes beginning to look dangerously sparkling
i am better
she makes me better
the nurse must bring up her tea with mine
we will have tea together
medlock and dr
craven looked at each other in a troubled way but there was evidently nothing to be done
he does look rather better sir ventured mrs
butthinking the matter overhe looked better this morning before she came into the room
she came into the room last night
she stayed with me a long time
she sang a hindustani song to me and it made me go to sleep said colin
i was better when i wakened up
i wanted my breakfast
i want my tea now
tell nurse medlock
craven did not stay very long
he talked to the nurse for a few minutes when she came into the room and said a few words of warning to
he must not talk too much he must not forget that he was ill he must not forget that he was very easily tired
mary thought that there seemed to be a number of uncomfortable things he was not to forget
colin looked fretful and kept his strange blacklashed eyes fixed on dr
cravens face
i want to forget it he said at last
she makes me forget it
that is why i want her
craven did not look happy when he left the room
he gave a puzzled glance at the little girl sitting on the large stool
she had become a stiff silent child again as soon as he entered and he could not see what the attraction was
the boy actually did look brighter howeverand he sighed rather heavily as he went down the corridor
they are always wanting me to eat things when i dont want to said
colin as the nurse brought in the tea and put it on the table by the sofa
now if youll eat i will
those muffins look so nice and hot
tell me about rajahs
chapter xv
nest building
after another week of rain the high arch of blue sky appeared again and the sun which poured down was quite hot
though there had been no chance to see either the secret garden or dickon mistress mary had enjoyed herself very much
the week had not seemed long
she had spent hours of every day with colin in his room talking about rajahs or gardens or
dickon and the cottage on the moor
they had looked at the splendid books and pictures and sometimes mary had read things to colin and sometimes he had read a little to her
when he was amused and interested she thought he scarcely looked like an invalid at all except that his face was so colorless and he was always on the sofa
you are a sly young one to listen and get out of your bed to go following things up like you did that night mrs
medlock said once
but theres no saying its not been a sort of blessing to the lot of us
hes not had a tantrum or a whining fit since you made friends
the nurse was just going to give up the case because she was so sick of him but she says she doesnt mind staying now youve gone on duty with her laughing a little
in her talks with colin mary had tried to be very cautious about the secret garden
there were certain things she wanted to find out from him but she felt that she must find them out without asking him direct questions
in the first place as she began to like to be with him she wanted to discover whether he was the kind of boy you could tell a secret to
he was not in the least like dickon but he was evidently so pleased with the idea of a garden no one knew anything about that she thought perhaps he could be trusted
but she had not known him long enough to be sure
the second thing she wanted to find out was this if he could be trustedif he really couldwouldnt it be possible to take him to the garden without having any one find it out
the grand doctor had said that he must have fresh air and colin had said that he would not mind fresh air in a secret garden
perhaps if he had a great deal of fresh air and knew dickon and the robin and saw things growing he might not think so much about dying
mary had seen herself in the glass sometimes lately when she had realized that she looked quite a different creature from the child she had seen when she arrived from india
this child looked nicer
even martha had seen a change in her
th air from th moor has done thee good already she had said
thart not nigh so yeller and thart not nigh so scrawny
even tha hair doesnt slamp down on tha head so flat
its got some life in it so as it sticks out a bit
its like me said mary
its growing stronger and fatter
im sure theres more of it
it looks it for sure said martha ruffling it up a little round her face
thart not half so ugly when its that way an theres a bit o red in tha cheeks
if gardens and fresh air had been good for her perhaps they would be good for colin
but then if he hated people to look at him perhaps he would not like to see dickon
why does it make you angry when you are looked at
she inquired one day
i always hated it he answered even when i was very little
then sometimes the ladies would pat my cheeks and say poor child
once when a lady did that i screamed out loud and bit her hand
she was so frightened she ran away
she thought you had gone mad like a dog said mary not at all admiringly
i dont care what she thought said colin frowning
i wonder why you didnt scream and bite me when i came into your room
then she began to smile slowly
i thought you were a ghost or a dream he said
you cant bite a ghost or a dream and if you scream they dont care
would you hate it ifif a boy looked at you
mary asked uncertainly
he lay back on his cushion and paused thoughtfully
theres one boy he said quite slowly as if he were thinking over every word theres one boy i believe i shouldnt mind
its that boy who knows where the foxes livedickon
im sure you wouldnt mind him said mary
the birds dont and other animals he said still thinking it over perhaps thats why i shouldnt
hes a sort of animal charmer and i am a boy animal
then he laughed and she laughed too in fact it ended in their both laughing a great deal and finding the idea of a boy animal hiding in his hole very funny indeed
what mary felt afterward was that she need not fear about dickon
on that first morning when the sky was blue again mary wakened very early
the sun was pouring in slanting rays through the blinds and there was something so joyous in the sight of it that she jumped out of bed and ran to the window
she drew up the blinds and opened the window itself and a great waft of fresh scented air blew in upon her
the moor was blue and the whole world looked as if something magic had happened to it
there were tender little fluting sounds here and there and everywhere as if scores of birds were beginning to tune up for a concert
mary put her hand out of the window and held it in the sun
its warmwarm
it will make the green points push up and up and up and it will make the bulbs and roots work and struggle with all their might under the earth
it must be very early she said
the little clouds are all pink and
ive never seen the sky look like this
no one is up
i dont even hear the stable boys
a sudden thought made her scramble to her feet
i cant wait
i am going to see the garden
she had learned to dress herself by this time and she put on her clothes in five minutes
she knew a small side door which she could unbolt herself and she flew downstairs in her stocking feet and put on her shoes in the hall
she ran around the shrubs and paths toward the secret garden
it is all different already she said
the grass is greener and things are sticking up everywhere and things are uncurling and green buds of leaves are showing
this afternoon i am sure dickon will come
the long warm rain had done strange things to the herbaceous beds which bordered the walk by the lower wall
there were things sprouting and pushing out from the roots of clumps of plants and there were actually here and there glimpses of royal purple and yellow unfurling among the stems of crocuses
six months before mistress mary would not have seen how the world was waking up but now she missed nothing
when she had reached the place where the door hid itself under the ivy she was startled by a curious loud sound
it was the cawcaw of a crow and it came from the top of the wall and when she looked up there sat a big glossyplumaged blueblack bird looking down at her very wisely indeed
she had never seen a crow so close before and he made her a little nervous but the next moment he spread his wings and flapped away across the garden
she hoped he was not going to stay inside and she pushed the door open wondering if he would
mary flew across the grass to him
she cried out
how could you get here so early
how could you
the sun has only just got up
he got up himself laughing and glowing and tousled his eyes like a bit of the sky
i was up long before him
how could i have stayed abed
th worlds all fair begun again this mornin it has
an its workin an hummin an scratchin an pipin an nestbuildin an breathin out scents till youve got to be out on it stead o lyin on your back
when th sun did jump up th moor went mad for joy an i was in the midst of th heather an i run like mad myself shoutin an singin
an i come straight here
i couldnt have stayed away
why th garden was lyin here waitin
mary put her hands on her chest panting as if she had been running herself
im so happy i can scarcely breathe
seeing him talking to a stranger the little bushytailed animal rose from its place under the tree and came to him and the rook cawing once flew down from its branch and settled quietly on his shoulder
this is th little fox cub he said rubbing the little reddish animals head
its named captain
an this heres soot
soot he flew across th moor with me an captain he run same as if th hounds had been after him
they both felt same as i did
neither of the creatures looked as if he were the least afraid of mary
when dickon began to walk about soot stayed on his shoulder and captain trotted quietly close to his side
said dickon
see how these has pushed up an these an these
look at these here
he threw himself upon his knees and mary went down beside him
they had come upon a whole clump of crocuses burst into purple and orange and gold
mary bent her face down and kissed and kissed them
you never kiss a person in that way she said when she lifted her head
flowers are so different
he looked puzzled but smiled
he said ive kissed mother many a time that way when i come in from th moor after a days roamin an she stood there at th door in th sun lookin so glad an comfortable
they ran from one part of the garden to another and found so many wonders that they were obliged to remind themselves that they must whisper or speak low
he showed her swelling leafbuds on rose branches which had seemed dead
he showed her ten thousand new green points pushing through the mould
there was every joy on earth in the secret garden that morning and in the midst of them came a delight more delightful than all because it was more wonderful
swiftly something flew across the wall and darted through the trees to a close grown corner a little flare of redbreasted bird with something hanging from its beak
dickon stood quite still and put his hand on mary almost as if they had suddenly found themselves laughing in a church
we munnot stir he whispered in broad yorkshire
we munnot scarce breathe
i knowed he was matehuntin when i seed him last
weatherstaffs robin
hes buildin his nest
hell stay here if us dont flight him
they settled down softly upon the grass and sat there without moving
us mustnt seem as if us was watchin him too close said dickon
hed be out with us for good if he got th notion us was interferin now
hell be a good bit different till all this is over
hes settin up housekeepin
hell be shyer an readier to take things ill
hes got no time for visitin an gossipin
us must keep still a bit an try to look as if us was grass an trees an bushes
then when hes got used to seein us ill chirp a bit an hell know usll not be in his way
mistress mary was not at all sure that she knew as dickon seemed to how to try to look like grass and trees and bushes
but he only sat wonderfully still and when he spoke dropped his voice to such a softness that it was curious that she could hear him but she could
its part o th springtime this nestbuildin is he said
i warrant its been goin on in th same way every year since th world was begun
theyve got their way o thinkin and doin things an a body had better not meddle
you can lose a friend in springtime easier than any other season if youre too curious
if we talk about him i cant help looking at him mary said as softly as possible
we must talk of something else
there is something i want to tell you
hell like it better if us talks o somethin else said dickon
what is it thas got to tell me
welldo you know about colin
she whispered
he turned his head to look at her
what does tha know about him
ive seen him
i have been to talk to him every day this week
he wants me to come
he says im making him forget about being ill and dying answered mary
dickon looked actually relieved as soon as the surprise died away from his round face
i am glad o that he exclaimed
im right down glad
it makes me easier
i knowed i must say nothin about him an i dont like havin to hide things
dont you like hiding the garden
ill never tell about it he answered
but i says to mother mother i says i got a secret to keep
its not a bad un tha knows that
its no worse than hidin where a birds nest is
tha doesnt mind it does tha
mary always wanted to hear about mother
what did she say
she asked not at all afraid to hear
dickon grinned sweettemperedly
it was just like her what she said he answered
she give my head a bit of a rub an laughed an she says eh lad tha can have all th secrets tha likes
ive knowed thee twelve year
how did you know about colin
asked mary
everybody as knowed about mester craven knowed there was a little lad as was like to be a cripple an they knowed mester craven didnt like him to be talked about
folks is sorry for mester craven because mrs
craven was such a pretty young lady an they was so fond of each other
medlock stops in our cottage whenever she goes to thwaite an she doesnt mind talkin to mother before us children because she knows us has been brought up to be trusty
how did tha find out about him
martha was in fine trouble th last time she came home
she said thad heard him frettin an tha was askin questions an she didnt know what to say
when she described the small ivorywhite face and the strange blackrimmed eyes dickon shook his head
thems just like his mothers eyes only hers was always laughin they say he said
they say as mr
craven cant bear to see him when hes awake an its because his eyes is so like his mothers an yet looks so different in his miserable bit of a face
do you think he wants him to die
whispered mary
no but he wishes hed never been born
mother she says thats th worst thing on earth for a child
them as is not wanted scarce ever thrives
mester craven hed buy anythin as money could buy for th poor lad but hed like to forget as hes on earth
for one thing hes afraid hell look at him some day and find hes growed hunchback
colins so afraid of it himself that he wont sit up said mary
he says hes always thinking that if he should feel a lump coming he should go crazy and scream himself to death
he oughtnt to lie there thinkin things like that said dickon
no lad could get well as thought them sort o things
the fox was lying on the grass close by him looking up to ask for a pat now and then and dickon bent down and rubbed his neck softly and thought a few minutes in silence
presently he lifted his head and looked round the garden
when first we got in here he said it seemed like everything was gray
look round now and tell me if tha doesnt see a difference
mary looked and caught her breath a little
she cried the gray wall is changing
it is as if a green mist were creeping over it
its almost like a green gauze veil
aye said dickon
an itll be greener and greener till th grays all gone
can tha guess what i was thinkin
i know it was something nice said mary eagerly
i believe it was something about colin
i was thinkin that if he was out here he wouldnt be watchin for lumps to grow on his back hed be watchin for buds to break on th rosebushes an hed likely be healthier explained dickon
i was wonderin if us could ever get him in th humor to come out here an lie under th trees in his carriage
ive been wondering that myself
ive thought of it almost every time
ive talked to him said mary
ive wondered if he could keep a secret and ive wondered if we could bring him here without any one seeing us
i thought perhaps you could push his carriage
the doctor said he must have fresh air and if he wants us to take him out no one dare disobey him
he wont go out for other people and perhaps they will be glad if he will go out with us
he could order the gardeners to keep away so they wouldnt find out
dickon was thinking very hard as he scratched captains back
itd be good for him ill warrant he said
usd not be thinkin hed better never been born
usd be just two children watchin a garden grow an hed be another
two lads an a little lass just lookin on at th springtime
i warrant itd be better than doctors stuff
hes been lying in his room so long and hes always been so afraid of his back that it has made him queer said mary
he knows a good many things out of books but he doesnt know anything else
he says he has been too ill to notice things and he hates going out of doors and hates gardens and gardeners
but he likes to hear about this garden because it is a secret
i darent tell him much but he said he wanted to see it
usll have him out here sometime for sure said dickon
i could push his carriage well enough
has tha noticed how th robin an his mate has been workin while weve been sittin here
look at him perched on that branch wonderin where itd be best to put that twig hes got in his beak
he made one of his low whistling calls and the robin turned his head and looked at him inquiringly still holding his twig
dickon spoke to him as ben weatherstaff did but dickons tone was one of friendly advice
wheresever tha puts it he said itll be all right
tha knew how to build tha nest before tha came out o th egg
get on with thee lad
thast got no time to lose
oh i do like to hear you talk to him
mary said laughing delightedly
ben weatherstaff scolds him and makes fun of him and he hops about and looks as if he understood every word and i know he likes it
ben weatherstaff says he is so conceited he would rather have stones thrown at him than not be noticed
dickon laughed too and went on talking
tha knows us wont trouble thee he said to the robin
us is near bein wild things ourselves
us is nestbuildin too bless thee
look out tha doesnt tell on us
chapter xvi i wont
they found a great deal to do that morning and mary was late in returning to the house and was also in such a hurry to get back to her work that she quite forgot colin until the last moment
tell colin that i cant come and see him yet she said to martha
im very busy in the garden
martha looked rather frightened
miss mary she said it may put him all out of humor when i tell him that
but mary was not as afraid of him as other people were and she was not a selfsacrificing person
i cant stay she answered
dickons waiting for me and she ran away
the afternoon was even lovelier and busier than the morning had been
already nearly all the weeds were cleared out of the garden and most of the roses and trees had been pruned or dug about
therell be apple blossoms an cherry blossoms overhead dickon said working away with all his might
an therell be peach an plum trees in bloom against th walls an th grassll be a carpet o flowers
the little fox and the rook were as happy and busy as they were and the robin and his mate flew backward and forward like tiny streaks of lightning
sometimes the rook flapped his black wings and soared away over the treetops in the park
each time he came back and perched near
dickon and cawed several times as if he were relating his adventures and dickon talked to him just as he had talked to the robin
dickon was so busy that he did not answer him at first soot flew on to his shoulders and gently tweaked his ear with his large beak
thas a good bit stronger than tha was dickon said looking at her as she was digging
thas beginning to look different for sure
mary was glowing with exercise and good spirits
im getting fatter and fatter every day she said quite exultantly
medlock will have to get me some bigger dresses
martha says my hair is growing thicker
it isnt so flat and stringy
the sun was beginning to set and sending deep goldcolored rays slanting under the trees when they parted
itll be fine tomorrow said dickon
ill be at work by sunrise
so will i said mary
she ran back to the house as quickly as her feet would carry her
she wanted to tell colin about dickons fox cub and the rook and about what the springtime had been doing
she felt sure he would like to hear
so it was not very pleasant when she opened the door of her room to see
martha standing waiting for her with a doleful face
what is the matter
what did colin say when you told him i couldnt come
said martha i wish thad gone
he was nigh goin into one o his tantrums
theres been a nice to do all afternoon to keep him quiet
he would watch the clock all th time
marys lips pinched themselves together
she was no more used to considering other people than colin was and she saw no reason why an illtempered boy should interfere with the thing she liked best
she knew nothing about the pitifulness of people who had been ill and nervous and who did not know that they could control their tempers and need not make other people ill and nervous too
when she had had a headache in india she had done her best to see that everybody else also had a headache or something quite as bad
and she felt she was quite right but of course now she felt that colin was quite wrong
he was not on his sofa when she went into his room
he was lying flat on his back in bed and he did not turn his head toward her as she came in
this was a bad beginning and mary marched up to him with her stiff manner
why didnt you get up
i did get up this morning when i thought you were coming he answered without looking at her
i made them put me back in bed this afternoon
my back ached and my head ached and i was tired
why didnt you come
i was working in the garden with dickon said mary
colin frowned and condescended to look at her
i wont let that boy come here if you go and stay with him instead of coming to talk to me he said
mary flew into a fine passion
she could fly into a passion without making a noise
she just grew sour and obstinate and did not care what happened
if you send dickon away ill never come into this room again
she retorted
youll have to if i want you said colin
ill make you said colin they shall drag you in
shall they mr
said mary fiercely
they may drag me in but they cant make me talk when they get me here
ill sit and clench my teeth and never tell you one thing
i wont even look at you
ill stare at the floor
they were a nice agreeable pair as they glared at each other
if they had been two little street boys they would have sprung at each other and had a roughandtumble fight
as it was they did the next thing to it
you are a selfish thing
cried colin
what are you
selfish people always say that
any one is selfish who doesnt do what they want
youre more selfish than i am
youre the most selfish boy i ever saw
snapped colin
im not as selfish as your fine dickon is
he keeps you playing in the dirt when he knows i am all by myself
hes selfish if you like
marys eyes flashed fire
hes nicer than any other boy that ever lived
heshes like an angel
it might sound rather silly to say that but she did not care
a nice angel
colin sneered ferociously
hes a common cottage boy off the moor
hes better than a common rajah
retorted mary
hes a thousand times better
because she was the stronger of the two she was beginning to get the better of him
the truth was that he had never had a fight with any one like himself in his life and upon the whole it was rather good for him though neither he nor mary knew anything about that
he turned his head on his pillow and shut his eyes and a big tear was squeezed out and ran down his cheek
he was beginning to feel pathetic and sorry for himselfnot for any one else
im not as selfish as you because im always ill and im sure there is a lump coming on my back he said
and i am going to die besides
contradicted mary unsympathetically
he opened his eyes quite wide with indignation
he had never heard such a thing said before
he was at once furious and slightly pleased if a person could be both at the same time
you know i am
everybody says so
i dont believe it
said mary sourly
you just say that to make people sorry
i believe youre proud of it
i dont believe it
if you were a nice boy it might be truebut youre too nasty
in spite of his invalid back colin sat up in bed in quite a healthy rage
get out of the room
he shouted and he caught hold of his pillow and threw it at her
he was not strong enough to throw it far and it only fell at her feet but marys face looked as pinched as a nutcracker
im going she said
and i wont come back
she walked to the door and when she reached it she turned round and spoke again
i was going to tell you all sorts of nice things she said
dickon brought his fox and his rook and i was going to tell you all about them
now i wont tell you a single thing
she marched out of the door and closed it behind her and there to her great astonishment she found the trained nurse standing as if she had been listening and more amazing stillshe was laughing
mary had never liked her and she simply stood and gazed up at her as she stood giggling into her handkerchief
what are you laughing at
she asked her
at you two young ones said the nurse
its the best thing that could happen to the sickly pampered thing to have some one to stand up to him thats as spoiled as himself and she laughed into her handkerchief again
if hed had a young vixen of a sister to fight with it would have been the saving of him
is he going to die
i dont know and i dont care said the nurse
hysterics and temper are half what ails him
what are hysterics
asked mary
youll find out if you work him into a tantrum after thisbut at any rate youve given him something to have hysterics about and im glad of it
mary went back to her room not feeling at all as she had felt when she had come in from the garden
she was cross and disappointed but not at all sorry for colin
she had looked forward to telling him a great many things and she had meant to try to make up her mind whether it would be safe to trust him with the great secret
she had been beginning to think it would be but now she had changed her mind entirely
she would never tell him and he could stay in his room and never get any fresh air and die if he liked
it would serve him right
she felt so sour and unrelenting that for a few minutes she almost forgot about dickon and the green veil creeping over the world and the soft wind blowing down from the moor
martha was waiting for her and the trouble in her face had been temporarily replaced by interest and curiosity
there was a wooden box on the table and its cover had been removed and revealed that it was full of neat packages
craven sent it to you said martha
it looks as if it had picturebooks in it
mary remembered what he had asked her the day she had gone to his room
do you want anythingdollstoysbooks
she opened the package wondering if he had sent a doll and also wondering what she should do with it if he had
but he had not sent one
there were several beautiful books such as colin had and two of them were about gardens and were full of pictures
there were two or three games and there was a beautiful little writingcase with a gold monogram on it and a gold pen and inkstand
everything was so nice that her pleasure began to crowd her anger out of her mind
she had not expected him to remember her at all and her hard little heart grew quite warm
i can write better than i can print she said and the first thing i shall write with that pen will be a letter to tell him i am much obliged
he had a way of doing that which she could not bear
it gave her an uncomfortable frightened feeling because he always looked so frightened himself
he said that if he felt even quite a little lump some day he should know his hunch had begun to grow
something he had heard mrs
medlock whispering to the nurse had given him the idea and he had thought over it in secret until it was quite firmly fixed in his mind
medlock had said his fathers back had begun to show its crookedness in that way when he was a child
he had never told any one but mary that most of his tantrums as they called them grew out of his hysterical hidden fear
mary had been sorry for him when he had told her
he always began to think about it when he was cross or tired she said to herself
and he has been cross today
perhapsperhaps he has been thinking about it all afternoon
she stood still looking down at the carpet and thinking
i said i would never go back again she hesitated knitting her browsbut perhaps just perhaps i will go and seeif he wants mein the morning
perhaps hell try to throw his pillow at me again buti thinkill go
chapter xvii
she had got up very early in the morning and had worked hard in the garden and she was tired and sleepy so as soon as martha had brought her supper and she had eaten it she was glad to go to bed
as she laid her head on the pillow she murmured to herself ill go out before breakfast and work with dickon and then afterwardi believeill go to see him
she thought it was the middle of the night when she was wakened by such dreadful sounds that she jumped out of bed in an instant
what was itwhat was it
the next minute she felt quite sure she knew
doors were opened and shut and there were hurrying feet in the corridors and some one was crying and screaming at the same time screaming and crying in a horrible way
its colin she said
hes having one of those tantrums the nurse called hysterics
how awful it sounds
as she listened to the sobbing screams she did not wonder that people were so frightened that they gave him his own way in everything rather than hear them
she put her hands over her ears and felt sick and shivering
i dont know what to do
i dont know what to do she kept saying
i cant bear it
once she wondered if he would stop if she dared go to him and then she remembered how he had driven her out of the room and thought that perhaps the sight of her might make him worse
even when she pressed her hands more tightly over her ears she could not keep the awful sounds out
she hated them so and was so terrified by them that suddenly they began to make her angry and she felt as if she should like to fly into a tantrum herself and frighten him as he was frightening her
she was not used to any ones tempers but her own
she took her hands from her ears and sprang up and stamped her foot
he ought to be stopped
somebody ought to make him stop
somebody ought to beat him
she cried out
just then she heard feet almost running down the corridor and her door opened and the nurse came in
she was not laughing now by any means
she even looked rather pale
hes worked himself into hysterics she said in a great hurry
hell do himself harm
no one can do anything with him
you come and try like a good child
he likes you
he turned me out of the room this morning said mary stamping her foot with excitement
the stamp rather pleased the nurse
the truth was that she had been afraid she might find mary crying and hiding her head under the bedclothes
thats right she said
youre in the right humor
you go and scold him
give him something new to think of
do go child as quick as ever you can
she flew along the corridor and the nearer she got to the screams the higher her temper mounted
she felt quite wicked by the time she reached the door
she slapped it open with her hand and ran across the room to the fourposted bed
she almost shouted
i hate you
everybody hates you
i wish everybody would run out of the house and let you scream yourself to death
you will scream yourself to death in a minute and
i wish you would
he had been lying on his face beating his pillow with his hands and he actually almost jumped around he turned so quickly at the sound of the furious little voice
his face looked dreadful white and red and swollen and he was gasping and choking but savage little mary did not care an atom
if you scream another scream she said ill scream tooand i can scream louder than you can and ill frighten you ill frighten you
he actually had stopped screaming because she had startled him so
the scream which had been coming almost choked him
the tears were streaming down his face and he shook all over
i cant stop
he gasped and sobbed
i canti cant
shouted mary
half that ails you is hysterics and temperjust hystericshystericshysterics
and she stamped each time she said it
i felt the lumpi felt it choked out colin
i knew i should
i shall have a hunch on my back and then i shall die and he began to writhe again and turned on his face and sobbed and wailed but he didnt scream
you didnt feel a lump
contradicted mary fiercely
if you did it was only a hysterical lump
hysterics makes lumps
theres nothing the matter with your horrid backnothing but hysterics
turn over and let me look at it
she liked the word hysterics and felt somehow as if it had an effect on him
he was probably like herself and had never heard it before
nurse she commanded come here and show me his back this minute
the nurse mrs
medlock and martha had been standing huddled together near the door staring at her their mouths half open
all three had gasped with fright more than once
the nurse came forward as if she were half afraid
colin was heaving with great breathless sobs
perhaps hehe wont let me she hesitated in a low voice
colin heard her however and he gasped out between two sobs shshow her
sheshell see then
it was a poor thin back to look at when it was bared
every rib could be counted and every joint of the spine though mistress mary did not count them as she bent over and examined them with a solemn savage little face
she looked so sour and oldfashioned that the nurse turned her head aside to hide the twitching of her mouth
there was just a minutes silence for even colin tried to hold his breath while mary looked up and down his spine and down and up as intently as if she had been the great doctor from london
theres not a single lump there
she said at last
theres not a lump as big as a pinexcept backbone lumps and you can only feel them because youre thin
ive got backbone lumps myself and they used to stick out as much as yours do until i began to get fatter and i am not fat enough yet to hide them
theres not a lump as big as a pin
if you ever say there is again i shall laugh
no one but colin himself knew what effect those crossly spoken childish words had on him
but he had lain and thought of himself and his aches and weariness for hours and days and months and years
and now that an angry unsympathetic little girl insisted obstinately that he was not as ill as he thought he was he actually felt as if she might be speaking the truth
i didnt know ventured the nurse that he thought he had a lump on his spine
his back is weak because he wont try to sit up
i could have told him there was no lump there
colin gulped and turned his face a little to look at her
ccould you
he said pathetically
said mary and she gulped too
actually the tears meant that a curious great relief had come to him
presently he turned and looked at the nurse again and strangely enough he was not like a rajah at all as he spoke to her
do you thinki couldlive to grow up
the nurse was neither clever nor softhearted but she could repeat some of the london doctors words
you probably will if you will do what you are told to do and not give way to your temper and stay out a great deal in the fresh air
colins tantrum had passed and he was weak and worn out with crying and this perhaps made him feel gentle
he put out his hand a little toward
mary and i am glad to say that her own tantrum having passed she was softened too and met him halfway with her hand so that it was a sort of making up
illill go out with you mary he said
i do so want to see
dickon and the fox and the crow
the nurse remade the tumbled bed and shook and straightened the pillows
then she made colin a cup of beef tea and gave a cup to mary who really was very glad to get it after her excitement
medlock and martha gladly slipped away and after everything was neat and calm and in order the nurse looked as if she would very gladly slip away also
you must go back and get your sleep out she said
hell drop off after a whileif hes not too upset
then ill lie down myself in the next room
would you like me to sing you that song i learned from my ayah
mary whispered to colin
his hand pulled hers gently and he turned his tired eyes on her appealingly
he answered
its such a soft song
i shall go to sleep in a minute
i will put him to sleep mary said to the yawning nurse
you can go if you like
well said the nurse with an attempt at reluctance
if he doesnt go to sleep in half an hour you must call me
very well answered mary
the nurse was out of the room in a minute and as soon as she was gone
colin pulled marys hand again
i almost told he said but i stopped myself in time
i wont talk and ill go to sleep but you said you had a whole lot of nice things to tell me
have youdo you think you have found out anything at all about the way into the secret garden
mary looked at his poor little tired face and swollen eyes and her heart relented
yees she answered i think i have
and if you will go to sleep i will tell you tomorrow
his hand quite trembled
if i could get into it i think i should live to grow up
do you suppose that instead of singing the ayah songyou could just tell me softly as you did that first day what you imagine it looks like inside
i am sure it will make me go to sleep
yes answered mary
shut your eyes
he closed his eyes and lay quite still and she held his hand and began to speak very slowly and in a very low voice
i think it has been left alone so longthat it has grown all into a lovely tangle
i think the roses have climbed and climbed and climbed until they hang from the branches and walls and creep over the groundalmost like a strange gray mist
some of them have died but manyare alive and when the summer comes there will be curtains and fountains of roses
i think the ground is full of daffodils and snowdrops and lilies and iris working their way out of the dark
now the spring has begunperhapsperhaps
the soft drone of her voice was making him stiller and stiller and she saw it and went on
perhaps they are coming up through the grassperhaps there are clusters of purple crocuses and gold oneseven now
perhaps the leaves are beginning to break out and uncurland perhapsthe gray is changing and a green gauze veil is creepingand creeping overeverything
and the birds are coming to look at itbecause it isso safe and still
and perhapsperhapsperhaps very softly and slowly indeed the robin has found a mateand is building a nest
and colin was asleep
