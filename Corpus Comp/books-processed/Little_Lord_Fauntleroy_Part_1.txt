little lord fauntleroy
by frances hodgson burnett
cedric himself knew nothing whatever about it
it had never been even mentioned to him
since his papas death cedric had found out that it was best not to talk to his mamma about him
when his father was ill cedric had been sent away and when he had returned everything was over and his mother who had been very ill too was only just beginning to sit in her chair by the window
she was pale and thin and all the dimples had gone from her pretty face and her eyes looked large and mournful and she was dressed in black
dearest said cedric his papa had called her that always and so the little boy had learned to say itdearest is my papa better
he felt her arms tremble and so he turned his curly head and looked in her face
there was something in it that made him feel that he was going to cry
dearest he said is he well
yes he is well she sobbed he is quite quite well but wewe have no one left but each other
no one at all
he and his mamma knew very few people and lived what might have been thought very lonely lives although cedric did not know it was lonely until he grew older and heard why it was they had no visitors
then he was told that his mamma was an orphan and quite alone in the world when his papa had married her
and after many strange things had happened they knew each other well and loved each other dearly and were married although their marriage brought them the illwill of several persons
he had two sons older than captain
but it so happened that nature had given to the youngest son gifts which she had not bestowed upon his elder brothers
and it was not so with his elder brothers neither of them was handsome or very kind or clever
when they were boys at eton they were not popular when they were at college they cared nothing for study and wasted both time and money and made few real friends
but after about six months he began to feel lonely and longed in secret to see his son again so he wrote to captain cedric and ordered him home
the letter he wrote crossed on its way a letter the captain had just written to his father telling of his love for the pretty
american girl and of his intended marriage and when the earl received that letter he was furiously angry
bad as his temper was he had never given way to it in his life as he gave way to it when he read the
captains letter
his valet who was in the room when it came thought his lordship would have a fit of apoplexy he was so wild with anger
for an hour he raged like a tiger and then he sat down and wrote to his son and ordered him never to come near his old home nor to write to his father or brothers again
he told him he might live as he pleased and die where he pleased that he should be cut off from his family forever and that he need never expect help from his father as long as he lived
the captain was very sad when he read the letter he was very fond of
at first he scarcely knew what to do he had not been brought up to work and had no business experience but he had courage and plenty of determination
so he sold his commission in the english army and after some trouble found a situation in new york and married
the change from his old life in england was very great but he was young and happy and he hoped that hard work would do great things for him in the future
she was very sweet indeed and her little boy was like both her and his father
though he was born in so quiet and cheap a little home it seemed as if there never had been a more fortunate baby
and every month of his life he grew handsomer and more interesting
his greatest charm was this cheerful fearless quaint little way of making friends with people
i think it arose from his having a very confiding nature and a kind little heart that sympathized with every one and wished to make every one as comfortable as he liked to be himself
it made him very quick to understand the feelings of those about him
perhaps this had grown on him too because he had lived so much with his father and mother who were always loving and considerate and tender and wellbred
he had never heard an unkind or uncourteous word spoken at home he had always been loved and caressed and treated tenderly and so his childish soul was full of kindness and innocent warm feeling
so when he knew his papa would come back no more and saw how very sad his mamma was there gradually came into his kind little heart the thought that he must do what he could to make her happy
he was not old enough to know of anything else to do so he did what he could and was more of a comfort to her than he could have understood
he heard her say once to her old servant i am sure he is trying to help me in his innocent wayi know he is
he looks at me sometimes with a loving wondering little look as if he were sorry for me and then he will come and pet me or show me something
he is such a little man i really think he knows
as he grew older he had a great many quaint little ways which amused and interested people greatly
he was so much of a companion for his mother that she scarcely cared for any other
they used to walk together and talk together and play together
errol laughing with delight at the quaint things he said
and indade said mary to the groceryman nobody cud help laughin at the quare little ways of himand his ouldfashioned sayins
an sez he to me mary sez he im very much intrusted in the lection sez he
im a publican an so is dearest
are you a publican mary
sorra a bit sez i im the bist o dimmycrats
an he looks up at me wid a look that ud go to yer heart an sez he mary sez he the country will go to ruin
an nivver a day since thin has he let go by widout argyin wid me to change me polytics
mary was very fond of him and very proud of him too
she had been with his mother ever since he was born and after his fathers death had been cook and housemaid and nurse and everything else
she was proud of his graceful strong little body and his pretty manners and especially proud of the bright curly hair which waved over his forehead and fell in charming lovelocks on his shoulders
she was willing to work early and late to help his mamma make his small suits and keep them in order
ristycratic is it
she would say
faith an id loike to see the choild on fifth aveynoo as looks loike him an shteps out as handsome as himself
an ivvery man woman and choild lookin afther him in his bit of a black velvet skirt made out of the misthresss ould gownd an his little head up an his curly hair flyin an shinin
its loike a young lord he looks
cedric did not know that he looked like a young lord he did not know what a lord was
his greatest friend was the groceryman at the cornerthe cross groceryman who was never cross to him
his name was
hobbs and cedric admired and respected him very much
he thought him a very rich and powerful person he had so many things in his storeprunes and figs and oranges and biscuitsand he had a horse and wagon
cedric was fond of the milkman and the baker and the applewoman but he liked mr
hobbs best of all and was on terms of such intimacy with him that he went to see him every day and often sat with him quite a long time discussing the topics of the hour
it was quite surprising how many things they found to talk aboutthe fourth of july for instance
when they began to talk about the fourth of july there really seemed no end to it
cedric was so excited that his eyes shone and his cheeks were red and his curls were all rubbed and tumbled into a yellow mop
he could hardly wait to eat his dinner after he went home he was so anxious to tell his mamma
it was perhaps mr
hobbs who gave him his first interest in politics
hobbs was fond of reading the newspapers and so cedric heard a great deal about what was going on in washington and mr
hobbs would tell him whether the president was doing his duty or not
and once when there was an election he found it all quite grand and probably but for mr
hobbs and cedric the country might have been wrecked
it was not long after this election when cedric was between seven and eight years old that the very strange thing happened which made so wonderful a change in his life
it was quite curious too that the day it happened he had been talking to mr
hobbs about england and the queen and mr
hobbs had said some very severe things about the aristocracy being specially indignant against earls and marquises
it had been a hot morning and after playing soldiers with some friends of his cedric had gone into the store to rest and had found mr
hobbs looking very fierce over a piece of the illustrated london news which contained a picture of some court ceremony
ah he said thats the way they go on now but theyll get enough of it some day when those theyve trod on rise and blow em up skyhighearls and marquises and all
its coming and they may look out for it
cedric had perched himself as usual on the high stool and pushed his hat back and put his hands in his pockets in delicate compliment to mr
did you ever know many marquises mr
cedric inquiredor earls
no answered mr
hobbs with indignation i guess not
id like to catch one of em inside here thats all
ill have no grasping tyrants sittin round on my crackerbarrels
and he was so proud of the sentiment that he looked around proudly and mopped his forehead
perhaps they wouldnt be earls if they knew any better said cedric feeling some vague sympathy for their unhappy condition
wouldnt they
they just glory in it
theyre a bad lot
they were in the midst of their conversation when mary appeared
cedric thought she had come to buy some sugar perhaps but she had not
she looked almost pale and as if she were excited about something
come home darlint she said the misthress is wantin yez
cedric slipped down from his stool
does she want me to go out with her mary
goodmorning
ill see you again
he was surprised to see mary staring at him in a dumfounded fashion and he wondered why she kept shaking her head
whats the matter mary
is it the hot weather
no said mary but theres strange things happenin to us
has the sun given dearest a headache
he inquired anxiously
but it was not that
when he reached his own house there was a coupe standing before the door and some one was in the little parlor talking to his mamma
mary hurried him upstairs and put on his best summer suit of creamcolored flannel with the red scarf around his waist and combed out his curly locks
lords is it
he heard her say
an the nobility an gintry
bad cess to them
lords indadeworse luck
it was really very puzzling but he felt sure his mamma would tell him what all the excitement meant so he allowed mary to bemoan herself without asking many questions
when he was dressed he ran downstairs and went into the parlor
a tall thin old gentleman with a sharp face was sitting in an armchair
his mother was standing near by with a pale face and he saw that there were tears in her eyes
she cried out and ran to her little boy and caught him in her arms and kissed him in a frightened troubled way
ceddie darling
the tall old gentleman rose from his chair and looked at cedric with his sharp eyes
he rubbed his thin chin with his bony hand as he looked
he seemed not at all displeased
and so he said at last slowlyand so this is little lord
fauntleroy
there was never a more amazed little boy than cedric during the week that followed there was never so strange or so unreal a week
in the first place the story his mamma told him was a very curious one
he was obliged to hear it two or three times before he could understand it
he could not imagine what mr
hobbs would think of it
he turned quite pale when he was first told of it
he said i should rather not be an earl
none of the boys are earls
cant i not be one
but it seemed to be unavoidable
and when that evening they sat together by the open window looking out into the shabby street he and his mother had a long talk about it
cedric sat on his footstool clasping one knee in his favorite attitude and wearing a bewildered little face rather red from the exertion of thinking
his grandfather had sent for him to come to england and his mamma thought he must go
because she said looking out of the window with sorrowful eyes i know your papa would wish it to be so ceddie
he loved his home very much and there are many things to be thought of that a little boy cant quite understand
i should be a selfish little mother if i did not send you
when you are a man you will see why
ceddie shook his head mournfully
i shall be very sorry to leave mr
hobbs he said
im afraid hell miss me and i shall miss him
and i shall miss them all
havishamwho was the family lawyer of the earl of dorincourt and who had been sent by him to bring lord fauntleroy to englandcame the next day cedric heard many things
he was troubled about his friend
hobbs and he went to see him at the store soon after breakfast in great anxiety of mind
he found him reading the morning paper and he approached him with a grave demeanor
he really felt it would be a great shock to mr
hobbs to hear what had befallen him and on his way to the store he had been thinking how it would be best to break the news
goodmorning said cedric
he did not climb up on the high stool as usual but sat down on a crackerbox and clasped his knee and was so silent for a few moments that mr
hobbs finally looked up inquiringly over the top of his newspaper
he said again
cedric gathered all his strength of mind together
hobbs he said do you remember what we were talking about yesterday morning
well replied mr
hobbsseems to me it was england
yes said cedric but just when mary came for me you know
hobbs rubbed the back of his head
we was mentioning queen victoria and the aristocracy
yes said cedric rather hesitatingly andand earls dont you know
why yes returned mr
hobbs we did touch em up a little thats so
cedric flushed up to the curly bang on his forehead
nothing so embarrassing as this had ever happened to him in his life
he was a little afraid that it might be a trifle embarrassing to mr
you said he proceeded that you wouldnt have them sitting round on your crackerbarrels
returned mr
hobbs stoutly
and i meant it
let em try itthats all
hobbs said cedric one is sitting on this box now
hobbs almost jumped out of his chair
he exclaimed
yes cedric announced with due modesty i am oneor i am going to be
i wont deceive you
hobbs looked agitated
he rose up suddenly and went to look at the thermometer
the mercurys got into your head
he exclaimed turning back to examine his young friends countenance
it is a hot day
how do you feel
got any pain
when did you begin to feel that way
he put his big hand on the little boys hair
this was more embarrassing than ever
thank you said ceddie im all right
there is nothing the matter with my head
im sorry to say its true mr
that was what mary came to take me home for
havisham was telling my mamma and he is a lawyer
hobbs sank into his chair and mopped his forehead with his handkerchief
one of us has got a sunstroke
he exclaimed
no returned cedric we havent
we shall have to make the best of it mr
havisham came all the way from england to tell us about it
my grandpapa sent him
hobbs stared wildly at the innocent serious little face before him
who is your grandfather
cedric put his hand in his pocket and carefully drew out a piece of paper on which something was written in his own round irregular hand
i couldnt easily remember it so i wrote it down on this he said
and he read aloud slowly john arthur molyneux errol earl of
dorincourt
that is his name and he lives in a castlein two or three castles i think
and my papa who died was his youngest son and i shouldnt have been a lord or an earl if my papa hadnt died and my papa wouldnt have been an earl if his two brothers hadnt died
but they all died and there is no one but meno boyand so i have to be one and my grandpapa has sent for me to come to england
hobbs seemed to grow hotter and hotter
he mopped his forehead and his bald spot and breathed hard
he was all the more bewildered because cedric gave it with such ingenuous simplicity and plainly without realizing himself how stupendous it was
whawhat did you say your name was
hobbs inquired
its cedric errol lord fauntleroy answered cedric
that was what
havisham called me
he said when i went into the room and so this is little lord fauntleroy
well said mr
hobbs ill bejiggered
this was an exclamation he always used when he was very much astonished or excited
he could think of nothing else to say just at that puzzling moment
cedric felt it to be quite a proper and suitable ejaculation
his respect and affection for mr
hobbs were so great that he admired and approved of all his remarks
he had not seen enough of society as yet to make him realize that sometimes mr
hobbs was not quite conventional
he knew of course that he was different from his mamma but then his mamma was a lady and he had an idea that ladies were always different from gentlemen
he looked at mr
hobbs wistfully
england is a long way off isnt it
its across the atlantic ocean mr
hobbs answered
thats the worst of it said cedric
perhaps i shall not see you again for a long time
i dont like to think of that mr
the best of friends must part said mr
well said cedric we have been friends for a great many years havent we
ever since you was born mr
hobbs answered
you was about six weeks old when you was first walked out on this street
ah remarked cedric with a sigh i never thought i should have to be an earl then
you think said mr
hobbs theres no getting out of it
im afraid not answered cedric
my mamma says that my papa would wish me to do it
but if i have to be an earl theres one thing i can do i can try to be a good one
im not going to be a tyrant
and if there is ever to be another war with america i shall try to stop it
his conversation with mr
hobbs was a long and serious one
once having got over the first shock mr
hobbs was not so rancorous as might have been expected he endeavored to resign himself to the situation and before the interview was at an end he had asked a great many questions
havisham could that gentleman have heard it
but then there were many things which astonished mr
he had spent all his life in england and was not accustomed to american people and american habits
he had known all about the old earls disappointment in his elder sons and all about his fierce rage at captain cedrics
american marriage and he knew how he still hated the gentle little widow and would not speak of her except with bitter and cruel words
he insisted that she was only a common american girl who had entrapped his son into marrying her because she knew he was an earls son
the old lawyer himself had more than half believed this was all true
he had seen a great many selfish mercenary people in his life and he had not a good opinion of americans
when he had been driven into the cheap street and his coupe had stopped before the cheap small house he had felt actually shocked
he wondered what kind of a child he would be and what kind of a mother he had
he rather shrank from seeing them both
it was a very old name and a very splendid one and mr
havisham had a great respect for it himself though he was only a cold keen businesslike old lawyer
when mary handed him into the small parlor he looked around it critically
not at all bad so far he had said to himself but perhaps the
captains taste predominated
but when mrs
errol came into the room he began to think she herself might have had something to do with it
if he had not been quite a selfcontained and stiff old gentleman he would probably have started when he saw her
she looked in the simple black dress fitting closely to her slender figure more like a young girl than the mother of a boy of seven
she had a pretty sorrowful young face and a very tender innocent look in her large brown eyesthe sorrowful look that had never quite left her face since her husband had died
he was fond of using long words and he was always pleased when they made her laugh though he could not understand why they were laughable they were quite serious matters with him
and he saw he should have no trouble with her and he began to feel that perhaps little lord fauntleroy might not be such a trial to his noble family after all
the captain had been a handsome fellow and the young mother was very pretty and perhaps the boy might be well enough to look at
when he first told mrs
errol what he had come for she turned very pale
she said will he have to be taken away from me
we love each other so much
he is such a happiness to me
he is all i have
i have tried to be a good mother to him
and her sweet young voice trembled and the tears rushed into her eyes
you do not know what he has been to me
the lawyer cleared his throat
i am obliged to tell you he said that the earl of dorincourt is notis not very friendly toward you
he is an old man and his prejudices are very strong
he has always especially disliked america and americans and was very much enraged by his sons marriage
i am sorry to be the bearer of so unpleasant a communication but he is very fixed in his determination not to see you
his plan is that lord
fauntleroy shall be educated under his own supervision that he shall live with him
the earl is attached to dorincourt castle and spends a great deal of time there
he is a victim to inflammatory gout and is not fond of london
lord fauntleroy will therefore be likely to live chiefly at dorincourt
the earl offers you as a home court lodge which is situated pleasantly and is not very far from the castle
he also offers you a suitable income
lord fauntleroy will be permitted to visit you the only stipulation is that you shall not visit him or enter the park gates
you see you will not be really separated from your son and
i assure you madam the terms are not so harsh asas they might have been
the advantage of such surroundings and education as lord
fauntleroy will have i am sure you must see will be very great
he felt a little uneasy lest she should begin to cry or make a scene as he knew some women would have done
it embarrassed and annoyed him to see women cry
but she did not
she went to the window and stood with her face turned away for a few moments and he saw she was trying to steady herself
captain errol was very fond of dorincourt she said at last
england and everything english
it was always a grief to him that he was parted from his home
he was proud of his home and of his name
he would wishi know he would wish that his son should know the beautiful old places and be brought up in such a way as would be suitable to his future position
then she came back to the table and stood looking up at mr
havisham very gently
my husband would wish it she said
it will be best for my little boy
i knowi am sure the earl would not be so unkind as to try to teach him not to love me and i knoweven if he triedthat my little boy is too much like his father to be harmed
he has a warm faithful nature and a true heart
he would love me even if he did not see me and so long as we may see each other i ought not to suffer very much
she thinks very little of herself the lawyer thought
she does not make any terms for herself
madam he said aloud i respect your consideration for your son
he will thank you for it when he is a man
i assure you lord fauntleroy will be most carefully guarded and every effort will be used to insure his happiness
the earl of dorincourt will be as anxious for his comfort and wellbeing as you yourself could be
i hope said the tender little mother in a rather broken voice that his grandfather will love ceddie
the little boy has a very affectionate nature and he has always been loved
havisham cleared his throat again
he could not quite imagine the gouty fierytempered old earl loving any one very much but he knew it would be to his interest to be kind in his irritable way to the child who was to be his heir
he knew too that if ceddie were at all a credit to his name his grandfather would be proud of him
lord fauntleroy will be comfortable i am sure he replied
it was with a view to his happiness that the earl desired that you should be near enough to him to see him frequently
he did not think it would be discreet to repeat the exact words the earl had used which were in fact neither polite nor amiable
havisham preferred to express his noble patrons offer in smoother and more courteous language
he had another slight shock when mrs
errol asked mary to find her little boy and bring him to her and mary told her where he was
sure ill foind him aisy enough maam she said for its wid mr
hobbs he is this minnit settin on his high shtool by the counther an talkin pollytics most loikely or enjyin hisself among the soap an candles an pertaties as sinsible an shwate as ye plase
hobbs has known him all his life mrs
errol said to the lawyer
he is very kind to ceddie and there is a great friendship between them
remembering the glimpse he had caught of the store as he passed it and having a recollection of the barrels of potatoes and apples and the various odds and ends mr
havisham felt his doubts arise again
in england gentlemens sons did not make friends of grocerymen and it seemed to him a rather singular proceeding
it would be very awkward if the child had bad manners and a disposition to like low company
one of the bitterest humiliations of the old earls life had been that his two elder sons had been fond of low company
could it be he thought that this boy shared their bad qualities instead of his fathers good qualities
he was thinking uneasily about this as he talked to mrs
errol until the child came into the room
when the door opened he actually hesitated a moment before looking at cedric
it would perhaps have seemed very queer to a great many people who knew him if they could have known the curious sensations that passed through mr
havisham when he looked down at the boy who ran into his mothers arms
he experienced a revulsion of feeling which was quite exciting
he recognized in an instant that here was one of the finest and handsomest little fellows he had ever seen
his beauty was something unusual
they were innocently fearless eyes he looked as if he had never feared or doubted anything in his life
he is the bestbredlooking and handsomest little fellow i ever saw was what mr
havisham thought
what he said aloud was simply and so this is little lord fauntleroy
and after this the more he saw of little lord fauntleroy the more of a surprise he found him
cedric did not know he was being observed and he only behaved himself in his ordinary manner
he shook hands with mr
havisham in his friendly way when they were introduced to each other and he answered all his questions with the unhesitating readiness with which he answered mr
he was neither shy nor bold and when mr
havisham was talking to his mother the lawyer noticed that he listened to the conversation with as much interest as if he had been quite grown up
he seems to be a very mature little fellow mr
havisham said to the mother
i think he is in some things she answered
he has always been very quick to learn and he has lived a great deal with grownup people
he has a funny little habit of using long words and expressions he has read in books or has heard others use but he is very fond of childish play
i think he is rather clever but he is a very boyish little boy sometimes
the next time mr
havisham met him he saw that this last was quite true
as his coupe turned the corner he caught sight of a group of small boys who were evidently much excited
two of them were about to run a race and one of them was his young lordship and he was shouting and making as much noise as the noisiest of his companions
he stood side by side with another boy one little red leg advanced a step
one to make ready
yelled the starter
two to be steady
threeand away
havisham found himself leaning out of the window of his coupe with a curious feeling of interest
he shut his small hands and set his face against the wind his bright hair streamed out behind
hooray ced errol
all the boys shouted dancing and shrieking with excitement
hooray billy williams
hooray ceddie
hooray billy
i really believe he is going to win said mr
i reallyi really cant help hoping he will win
he said with an apologetic sort of cough
at that moment the wildest yell of all went up from the dancing hopping boys
with one last frantic leap the future earl of dorincourt had reached the lamppost at the end of the block and touched it just two seconds before billy williams flung himself at it panting
three cheers for ceddie errol
yelled the little boys
hooray for
ceddie errol
havisham drew his head in at the window of his coupe and leaned back with a dry smile
bravo lord fauntleroy
as his carriage stopped before the door of mrs
errols house the victor and the vanquished were coming toward it attended by the clamoring crew
cedric walked by billy williams and was speaking to him
his elated little face was very red his curls clung to his hot moist forehead his hands were in his pockets
you see he was saying evidently with the intention of making defeat easy for his unsuccessful rival i guess i won because my legs are a little longer than yours
i guess that was it
you see im three days older than you and that gives me a vantage
im three days older
and this view of the case seemed to cheer billy williams so much that he began to smile on the world again and felt able to swagger a little almost as if he had won the race instead of losing it
somehow ceddie
errol had a way of making people feel comfortable
that morning mr
havisham had quite a long conversation with the winner of the racea conversation which made him smile his dry smile and rub his chin with his bony hand several times
errol had been called out of the parlor and the lawyer and cedric were left together
at first mr
havisham wondered what he should say to his small companion
he had an idea that perhaps it would be best to say several things which might prepare cedric for meeting his grandfather and perhaps for the great change that was to come to him
he could see that cedric had not the least idea of the sort of thing he was to see when he reached england or of the sort of home that waited for him there
he did not even know yet that his mother was not to live in the same house with him
they had thought it best to let him get over the first shock before telling him
havisham sat in an armchair on one side of the open window on the other side was another still larger chair and cedric sat in that and looked at mr
he sat well back in the depths of his big seat his curly head against the cushioned back his legs crossed and his hands thrust deep into his pockets in a quite mr
hobbslike way
he had been watching mr
havisham very steadily when his mamma had been in the room and after she was gone he still looked at him in respectful thoughtfulness
there was a short silence after mrs
errol went out and cedric seemed to be studying mr
havisham and mr
havisham was certainly studying cedric
but cedric relieved him by suddenly beginning the conversation himself
do you know he said i dont know what an earl is
no replied ceddie
and i think when a boy is going to be one he ought to know
wellyes answered mr
would you mind said ceddie respectfullywould you mind splaining it to me
sometimes when he used his long words he did not pronounce them quite correctly
what made him an earl
a king or queen in the first place said mr
generally he is made an earl because he has done some service to his sovereign or some great deed
said cedric thats like the president
is that why your presidents are elected
yes answered ceddie cheerfully
when a man is very good and knows a great deal he is elected president
they have torchlight processions and bands and everybody makes speeches
i used to think i might perhaps be a president but i never thought of being an earl
i didnt know about earls he said rather hastily lest mr
havisham might feel it impolite in him not to have wished to be oneif id known about them
i dare say i should have thought i should like to be one
it is rather different from being a president said mr
asked cedric
are there no torchlight processions
havisham crossed his own legs and put the tips of his fingers carefully together
he thought perhaps the time had come to explain matters rather more clearly
an earl isis a very important person he began
so is a president
put in ceddie
the torchlight processions are five miles long and they shoot up rockets and the band plays
hobbs took me to see them
an earl mr
havisham went on feeling rather uncertain of his ground is frequently of very ancient lineage whats that
asked ceddie
of very old familyextremely old
said cedric thrusting his hands deeper into his pockets
i suppose that is the way with the applewoman near the park
i dare say she is of ancient linlenage
she is so old it would surprise you how she can stand up
shes a hundred i should think and yet she is out there when it rains even
im sorry for her and so are the other boys
billy williams once had nearly a dollar and i asked him to buy five cents worth of apples from her every day until he had spent it all
that made twenty days and he grew tired of apples after a week but thenit was quite fortunatea gentleman gave me fifty cents and i bought apples from her instead
you feel sorry for any one thats so poor and has such ancient linlenage
she says hers has gone into her bones and the rain makes it worse
havisham felt rather at a loss as he looked at his companions innocent serious little face
i am afraid you did not quite understand me he explained
like george washington said ceddie
ive heard of him ever since i was born and he was known about long before that
hobbs says he will never be forgotten
thats because of the declaration of
independence you know and the fourth of july
you see he was a very brave man
the first earl of dorincourt said mr
havisham solemnly was created an earl four hundred years ago
said ceddie
that was a long time ago
did you tell
dearest that
it would intrust her very much
well tell her when she comes in
she always likes to hear curus things
what else does an earl do besides being created
a great many of them have helped to govern england
some of them have been brave men and have fought in great battles in the old days
i should like to do that myself said cedric
my papa was a soldier and he was a very brave manas brave as george washington
perhaps that was because he would have been an earl if he hadnt died
i am glad earls are brave
thats a great vantageto be a brave man
once i used to be rather afraid of thingsin the dark you know but when i thought about the soldiers in the revolution and george washingtonit cured me
there is another advantage in being an earl sometimes said mr
havisham slowly and he fixed his shrewd eyes on the little boy with a rather curious expression
some earls have a great deal of money
he was curious because he wondered if his young friend knew what the power of money was
thats a good thing to have said ceddie innocently
i wish i had a great deal of money
well explained cedric there are so many things a person can do with money
you see theres the applewoman
if i were very rich i should buy her a little tent to put her stall in and a little stove and then
i should give her a dollar every morning it rained so that she could afford to stay at home
and thenoh
id give her a shawl
and you see her bones wouldnt feel so badly
her bones are not like our bones they hurt her when she moves
its very painful when your bones hurt you
if i were rich enough to do all those things for her i guess her bones would be all right
and what else would you do if you were rich
id do a great many things
of course i should buy dearest all sorts of beautiful things needlebooks and fans and gold thimbles and rings and an encyclopedia and a carriage so that she neednt have to wait for the streetcars
if she liked pink silk dresses i should buy her some but she likes black best
but id take her to the big stores and tell her to look round and choose for herself
and then dick who is dick
dick is a bootblack said his young lordship quite warming up in his interest in plans so exciting
he is one of the nicest bootblacks you ever knew
he stands at the corner of a street downtown
ive known him for years
i had kilts on
and dick was blacking a mans shoes and he said hello
and he ran in between the horses and caught the ball for me and wiped it off with his coat and gave it to me and said its all right young un
so dearest admired him very much and so did
i and ever since then when we go downtown we talk to him
he says hello
and i say hello
and then we talk a little and he tells me how trade is
its been bad lately
and what would you like to do for him
inquired the lawyer rubbing his chin and smiling a queer smile
well said lord fauntleroy settling himself in his chair with a business air id buy jake out
and who is jake
havisham asked
hes dicks partner and he is the worst partner a fellow could have
dick says so
he isnt a credit to the business and he isnt square
he cheats and that makes dick mad
it would make you mad you know if you were blacking boots as hard as you could and being square all the time and your partner wasnt square at all
people like dick but they dont like jake and so sometimes they dont come twice
so if i were rich
id buy jake out and get dick a boss signhe says a boss sign goes a long way and id get him some new clothes and new brushes and start him out fair
he says all he wants is to start out fair
there could have been nothing more confiding and innocent than the way in which his small lordship told his little story quoting his friend
dicks bits of slang in the most candid good faith
he seemed to feel not a shade of a doubt that his elderly companion would be just as interested as he was himself
and in truth mr
is there anything he began
what would you get for yourself if you were rich
lots of things
answered lord fauntleroy briskly but first id give
mary some money for bridgetthats her sister with twelve children and a husband out of work
she comes here and cries and dearest gives her things in a basket and then she cries again and says blessins be on yez for a beautiful lady
and i think mr
hobbs would like a gold watch and chain to remember me by and a meerschaum pipe
id like to get up a company
exclaimed mr
like a republican rally explained cedric becoming quite excited
id have torches and uniforms and things for all the boys and myself too
and wed march you know and drill
thats what i should like for myself if i were rich
the door opened and mrs
errol came in
i am sorry to have been obliged to leave you so long she said to mr
havisham but a poor woman who is in great trouble came to see me
this young gentleman said mr
havisham has been telling me about some of his friends and what he would do for them if he were rich
bridget is one of his friends said mrs
errol and it is bridget to whom i have been talking in the kitchen
she is in great trouble now because her husband has rheumatic fever
cedric slipped down out of his big chair
i think ill go and see her he said and ask her how he is
hes a nice man when he is well
im obliged to him because he once made me a sword out of wood
hes a very talented man
he ran out of the room and mr
havisham rose from his chair
he seemed to have something in his mind which he wished to speak of
he hesitated a moment and then said looking down at mrs
errol before i left dorincourt castle i had an interview with the earl in which he gave me some instructions
he is desirous that his grandson should look forward with some pleasure to his future life in england and also to his acquaintance with himself
for the second time he did not repeat the earls exact words
his lordship had indeed said make the lad understand that i can give him anything he wants
let him know what it is to be the grandson of the earl of dorincourt
buy him everything he takes a fancy to let him have money in his pockets and tell him his grandfather put it there
his motives were far from being good and if he had been dealing with a nature less affectionate and warmhearted than little lord fauntleroys great harm might have been done
and cedrics mother was too gentle to suspect any harm
she thought that perhaps this meant that a lonely unhappy old man whose children were dead wished to be kind to her little boy and win his love and confidence
and it pleased her very much to think that ceddie would be able to help bridget
it made her happier to know that the very first result of the strange fortune which had befallen her little boy was that he could do kind things for those who needed kindness
quite a warm color bloomed on her pretty young face
she said that was very kind of the earl cedric will be so glad
he has always been fond of bridget and michael
they are quite deserving
i have often wished i had been able to help them more
michael is a hardworking man when he is well but he has been ill a long time and needs expensive medicines and warm clothing and nourishing food
he and bridget will not be wasteful of what is given them
havisham put his thin hand in his breast pocket and drew forth a large pocketbook
there was a queer look in his keen face
the truth was he was wondering what the earl of dorincourt would say when he was told what was the first wish of his grandson that had been granted
he wondered what the cross worldly selfish old nobleman would think of it
i do not know that you have realized he said that the earl of
dorincourt is an exceedingly rich man
he can afford to gratify any caprice
i think it would please him to know that lord fauntleroy had been indulged in any fancy
if you will call him back and allow me i shall give him five pounds for these people
that would be twentyfive dollars
exclaimed mrs
it will seem like wealth to them
i can scarcely believe that it is true
it is quite true said mr
havisham with his dry smile
a great change has taken place in your sons life a great deal of power will lie in his hands
cried his mother
and he is such a little boya very little boy
how can i teach him to use it well
it makes me half afraid
my pretty little ceddie
the lawyer slightly cleared his throat
it touched his worldly hard old heart to see the tender timid look in her brown eyes
i think madam he said that if i may judge from my interview with
lord fauntleroy this morning the next earl of dorincourt will think for others as well as for his noble self
he is only a child yet but i think he may be trusted
then his mother went for cedric and brought him back into the parlor
havisham heard him talking before he entered the room
its infamnatory rheumatism he was saying and thats a kind of rheumatism thats dreadful
and he thinks about the rent not being paid and bridget says that makes the infammation worse
and pat could get a place in a store if he had some clothes
his little face looked quite anxious when he came in
he was very sorry for bridget
dearest said you wanted me he said to mr
ive been talking to bridget
havisham looked down at him a moment
he felt a little awkward and undecided
as cedrics mother had said he was a very little boy
the earl of dorincourt he began and then he glanced involuntarily at mrs
little lord fauntleroys mother suddenly kneeled down by him and put both her tender arms around his childish body
ceddie she said the earl is your grandpapa your own papas father
he is very very kind and he loves you and wishes you to love him because the sons who were his little boys are dead
he wishes you to be happy and to make other people happy
he is very rich and he wishes you to have everything you would like to have
he told mr
havisham so and gave him a great deal of money for you
you can give some to bridget now enough to pay her rent and buy michael everything
isnt that fine
isnt he good
and she kissed the child on his round cheek where the bright color suddenly flashed up in his excited amazement
he looked from his mother to mr
can i have it now
can i give it to her this minute
shes just going
havisham handed him the money
it was in fresh clean greenbacks and made a neat roll
ceddie flew out of the room with it
they heard him shout as he tore into the kitchen
bridget wait a minute
heres some money
its for you and you can pay the rent
my grandpapa gave it to me
its for you and michael
oh master ceddie
cried bridget in an awestricken voice
its twintyfoive dollars is here
where bes the misthress
i think i shall have to go and explain it to her mrs
errol said
so she too went out of the room and mr
havisham was left alone for a while
he went to the window and stood looking out into the street reflectively
in spite of all his splendor there was never a more unpopular old nobleman than the earl of dorincourt and there could scarcely have been a more lonely one
he could fill his castle with guests if he chose
he could give great dinners and splendid hunting parties but he knew that in secret the people who would accept his invitations were afraid of his frowning old face and sarcastic biting speeches
he had a cruel tongue and a bitter nature and he took pleasure in sneering at people and making them feel uncomfortable when he had the power to do so because they were sensitive or proud or timid
havisham knew his hard fierce ways by heart and he was thinking of him as he looked out of the window into the narrow quiet street
it will make a great difference he said to himself
it will make a great difference
cedric and his mother came back soon after
cedric was in high spirits
he sat down in his own chair between his mother and the lawyer and fell into one of his quaint attitudes with his hands on his knees
he was glowing with enjoyment of bridgets relief and rapture
she said she was crying for joy
i never saw any one cry for joy before
my grandpapa must be a very good man
i didnt know he was so good a man
its moremore agreeabler to be an earl than
i thought it was
im almost gladim almost quite glad im going to be one
cedrics good opinion of the advantages of being an earl increased greatly during the next week
it seemed almost impossible for him to realize that there was scarcely anything he might wish to do which he could not do easily in fact i think it may be said that he did not fully realize it at all
but at least he understood after a few conversations with mr
havisham that he could gratify all his nearest wishes and he proceeded to gratify them with a simplicity and delight which caused mr
havisham much diversion
in the week before they sailed for england he did many curious things
for i have to go to england and be a lord explained cedric sweettemperedly
and i shouldnt like to have your bones on my mind every time it rained
my own bones never hurt so i think i dont know how painful a persons bones can be but ive sympathized with you a great deal and i hope youll be better
shes a very good applewoman he said to mr
havisham as they walked away leaving the proprietress of the stall almost gasping for breath and not at all believing in her great fortune
once when i fell down and cut my knee she gave me an apple for nothing
ive always remembered her for it
you know you always remember people who are kind to you
it had never occurred to his honest simple little mind that there were people who could forget kindnesses
the interview with dick was quite exciting
dick had just been having a great deal of trouble with jake and was in low spirits when they saw him
his amazement when cedric calmly announced that they had come to give him what seemed a very great thing to him and would set all his troubles right almost struck him dumb
lord fauntleroys manner of announcing the object of his visit was very simple and unceremonious
havisham was much impressed by its directness as he stood by and listened
the statement that his old friend had become a lord and was in danger of being an earl if he lived long enough caused dick to so open his eyes and mouth and start that his cap fell off
when he picked it up he uttered a rather singular exclamation
havisham thought it singular but cedric had heard it before
he said whatre yer givin us
this plainly embarrassed his lordship a little but he bore himself bravely
everybody thinks it not true at first he said
hobbs thought
id had a sunstroke
i didnt think i was going to like it myself but i like it better now im used to it
the one who is the earl now hes my grandpapa and he wants me to do anything i like
hes very kind if he is an earl and he sent me a lot of money by mr
havisham and ive brought some to you to buy jake out
and the end of the matter was that dick actually bought jake out and found himself the possessor of the business and some new brushes and a most astonishing sign and outfit
he scarcely seemed to realize anything until cedric put out his hand to shake hands with him before going away
well goodbye he said and though he tried to speak steadily there was a little tremble in his voice and he winked his big brown eyes
and i hope tradell be good
im sorry im going away to leave you but perhaps i shall come back again when im an earl
and i wish youd write to me because we were always good friends
and if you write to me heres where you must send your letter
and he gave him a slip of paper
and my name isnt cedric errol any more its lord fauntleroy andand goodbye dick
dick winked his eyes also and yet they looked rather moist about the lashes
i wish ye wasnt goin away he said in a husky voice
then he winked his eyes again
then he looked at mr
havisham and touched his cap
thanky sir fur bringin him down here an fur wot yeve done
heshes a queer little feller he added
ive allers thort a heap of him
hes such a game little feller anan such a queer little un
until the day of his departure his lordship spent as much time as possible with mr
hobbs in the store
gloom had settled upon mr
hobbs he was much depressed in spirits
when his young friend brought to him in triumph the parting gift of a gold watch and chain mr
hobbs found it difficult to acknowledge it properly
he laid the case on his stout knee and blew his nose violently several times
theres something written on it said cedricinside the case
i told the man myself what to say
from his oldest friend lord
fauntleroy to mr
when this you see remember me
i dont want you to forget me
hobbs blew his nose very loudly again
i shant forget you he said speaking a trifle huskily as dick had spoken nor dont you go and forget me when you get among the british arrystocracy
i shouldnt forget you whoever i was among answered his lordship
ive spent my happiest hours with you at least some of my happiest hours
i hope youll come to see me sometime
im sure my grandpapa would be very much pleased
perhaps hell write and ask you when i tell him about you
youyou wouldnt mind his being an earl would you i mean you wouldnt stay away just because he was one if he invited you to come
id come to see you replied mr
hobbs graciously
at last all the preparations were complete the day came when the trunks were taken to the steamer and the hour arrived when the carriage stood at the door
then a curious feeling of loneliness came upon the little boy
his mamma had been shut up in her room for some time when she came down the stairs her eyes looked large and wet and her sweet mouth was trembling
cedric went to her and she bent down to him and he put his arms around her and they kissed each other
he knew something made them both sorry though he scarcely knew what it was but one tender little thought rose to his lips
we liked this little house dearest didnt we
we always will like it wont we
yesyes she answered in a low sweet voice
yes darling
and then they went into the carriage and cedric sat very close to her and as she looked back out of the window he looked at her and stroked her hand and held it close
some one was hurriedly forcing his way through this group and coming toward him
it was a boy with something red in his hand
he came up to cedric quite breathless
ive run all the way he said
ive come down to see ye off
trades been prime
i bought this for ye out o what i made yesterday
ye kin wear it when ye get among the swells
i lost the paper when i was tryin to get through them fellers downstairs
they didnt want to let me up
its a hankercher
he poured it all forth as if in one sentence
a bell rang and he made a leap away before cedric had time to speak
wear it when ye get among the swells
and he darted off and was gone
a few seconds later they saw him struggle through the crowd on the lower deck and rush on shore just before the gangplank was drawn in
he stood on the wharf and waved his cap
cedric held the handkerchief in his hand
it was of bright red silk ornamented with purple horseshoes and horses heads
there was a great straining and creaking and confusion
the people on the wharf began to shout to their friends and the people on the steamer shouted back goodbye
goodbye old fellow
every one seemed to be saying dont forget us
write when you get to liverpool
little lord fauntleroy leaned forward and waved the red handkerchief
goodbye dick
he shouted lustily
goodbye dick
and the big steamer moved away and the people cheered again and
as little lord fauntleroy steamed slowly away from the home of his birth to the unknown land of his ancestors
it was during the voyage that cedrics mother told him that his home was not to be hers and when he first understood it his grief was so great that mr
havisham saw that the earl had been wise in making the arrangements that his mother should be quite near him and see him often for it was very plain he could not have borne the separation otherwise
but his mother managed the little fellow so sweetly and lovingly and made him feel that she would be so near him that after a while he ceased to be oppressed by the fear of any real parting
and we shall be so happy together
it is a beautiful place
your papa has often told me about it
he loved it very much and you will love it too
i should love it better if you were there his small lordship said with a heavy little sigh
he could not but feel puzzled by so strange a state of affairs which could put his dearest in one house and himself in another
the fact was that mrs
errol had thought it better not to tell him why this plan had been made
i should prefer he should not be told she said to mr
he would not really understand he would only be shocked and hurt and
i feel sure that his feeling for the earl will be a more natural and affectionate one if he does not know that his grandfather dislikes me so bitterly
he has never seen hatred or hardness and it would be a great blow to him to find out that any one could hate me
he is so loving himself and i am so dear to him
it is better for him that he should not be told until he is much older and it is far better for the earl
it would make a barrier between them even though ceddie is such a child
so cedric only knew that there was some mysterious reason for the arrangement some reason which he was not old enough to understand but which would be explained when he was older
havisham saw him sitting in some queer little oldfashioned attitude watching the sea with a very grave face and more than once he heard an unchildish sigh rise to his lips
i dont like it he said once as he was having one of his almost venerable talks with the lawyer
you dont know how much i dont like it but there are a great many troubles in this world and you have to bear them
mary says so and ive heard mr
hobbs say it too
dearest wants me to like to live with my grandpapa because you see all his children are dead and thats very mournful
it makes you sorry for a man when all his children have diedand one was killed suddenly
gradually mr
havisham had begun to derive a great deal of private pleasure and amusement from his society
and so you are going to try to like the earl he said
yes answered his lordship
hes my relation and of course you have to like your relations and besides hes been very kind to me
do you think suggested mr
havisham that he will be fond of you
remarked the lawyer thats it is it
yes said cedric thats it
dont you think thats it too
of course a man would be fond of his grandson
every one liked him he made friends everywhere
he was ever ready to make friends
it surprised him when they laughed
he had picked up this seafaring remark from an elderly naval man of the name of jerry who told him stories in which it occurred frequently
judging also by these same exciting adventures he had been partially roasted and eaten frequently and had been scalped some fifteen or twenty times
that is why he is so bald explained lord fauntleroy to his mamma
after you have been scalped several times the hair never grows again
jerrys never grew again after that last time when the king of the
parromachaweekins did it with the knife made out of the skull of the
chief of the wopslemumpkies
he says it was one of the most serious times he ever had
he was so frightened that his hair stood right straight up when the king flourished his knife and it never would lie down and the king wears it that way now and it looks something like a hairbrush
i never heard anything like the asperiences jerry has had
i should so like to tell mr
hobbs about them
he was always innocently and goodnaturedly ready to do his small best to add to the general entertainment and there was a charm in the very unconsciousness of his own childish importance
jerrys stories intrust them very much he said to his mamma
being scalped a great many times might make a person forgetful
it was eleven days after he had said goodbye to his friend dick before he reached liverpool and it was on the night of the twelfth day that the carriage in which he and his mother and mr
havisham had driven from the station stopped before the gates of court lodge
they could not see much of the house in the darkness
mary had come with them to attend her mistress and she had reached the house before them
when cedric jumped out of the carriage he saw one or two servants standing in the wide bright hall and mary stood in the doorway
lord fauntleroy sprang at her with a gay little shout
did you get here mary
heres mary dearest and he kissed the maid on her rough red cheek
i am glad you are here mary mrs
errol said to her in a low voice
it is such a comfort to me to see you
it takes the strangeness away
and she held out her little hand which mary squeezed encouragingly
she knew how this first strangeness must feel to this little mother who had left her own land and was about to give up her child
the english servants looked with curiosity at both the boy and his mother
they had heard all sorts of rumors about them both they knew how angry the old earl had been and why mrs
errol was to live at the lodge and her little boy at the castle they knew all about the great fortune he was to inherit and about the savage old grandfather and his gout and his tempers
hell have no easy time of it poor little chap they had said among themselves
but they did not know what sort of a little lord had come among them they did not quite understand the character of the next earl of
dorincourt
he pulled off his overcoat quite as if he were used to doing things for himself and began to look about him
he looked about the broad hall at the pictures and stags antlers and curious things that ornamented it
they seemed curious to him because he had never seen such things before in a private house
dearest he said this is a very pretty house isnt it
i am glad you are going to live here
its quite a large house
it was quite a large house compared to the one in the shabby new york street and it was very pretty and cheerful
mary led them upstairs to a bright chintzhung bedroom where a fire was burning and a large snowwhite persian cat was sleeping luxuriously on the white fur hearthrug
it was the housekaper up at the castle maam sint her to yez explained mary
its herself is a kindhearted lady an has had iverything done to prepar fur yez
i seen her meself a few minnits an she was fond av the captin maam an graivs fur him and she said to say the big cat slapin on the rug moight make the room same homeloike to yez
she knowed captin errol whin he was a byean a foine handsum bye she ses he was an a foine young man wid a plisint word fur every one great an shmall
an ses i to her ses i hes lift a bye thats loike him maam fur a foiner little felly niver sthipped in shoeleather
there was a great tigerskin before the fire and an armchair on each side of it
cedric was so pleased that he put his head down by hers and lay stroking her not noticing what his mother and mr
havisham were saying
they were indeed speaking in a rather low tone
errol looked a little pale and agitated
he need not go tonight
he will stay with me tonight
yes answered mr
havisham in the same low tone it will not be necessary for him to go tonight
i myself will go to the castle as soon as we have dined and inform the earl of our arrival
errol glanced down at cedric
errol smiled faintly
his lordship does not know all that he is taking from me she said rather sadly
then she looked at the lawyer
will you tell him if you please she said that i should rather not have the money
havisham exclaimed
you can not mean the income he proposed to settle upon you
yes she answered quite simply i think i should rather not have it
as he dislikes me so much i should feel a little as if i were selling cedric to him
i am giving him up only because i love him enough to forget myself for his good and because his father would wish it to be so
havisham rubbed his chin
this is very strange he said
he will be very angry
he wont understand it
i think he will understand it after he thinks it over she said
i do not really need the money and why should i accept luxuries from the man who hates me so much that he takes my little boy from mehis sons child
havisham looked reflective for a few moments
i will deliver your message he said afterward
and then the dinner was brought in and they sat down together the big cat taking a seat on a chair near cedrics and purring majestically throughout the meal
when later in the evening mr
havisham presented himself at the
castle he was taken at once to the earl
he found him sitting by the fire in a luxurious easychair his foot on a goutstool
he looked at the lawyer sharply from under his shaggy eyebrows but mr
havisham could see that in spite of his pretense at calmness he was nervous and secretly excited
well he said well havisham come back have you
whats the news
lord fauntleroy and his mother are at court lodge replied mr
they bore the voyage very well and are in excellent health
the earl made a halfimpatient sound and moved his hand restlessly
glad to hear it he said brusquely
so far so good
make yourself comfortable
have a glass of wine and settle down
his lordship remains with his mother tonight
tomorrow i will bring him to the castle
the earls elbow was resting on the arm of his chair he put his hand up and shielded his eyes with it
well he said go on
you know i told you not to write to me about the matter and i know nothing whatever about it
what kind of a lad is he
i dont care about the mother what sort of a lad is he
havisham drank a little of the glass of port he had poured out for himself and sat holding it in his hand
it is rather difficult to judge of the character of a child of seven he said cautiously
the earls prejudices were very intense
he looked up quickly and uttered a rough word
a fool is he
he exclaimed
or a clumsy cub
his american blood tells does it
i do not think it has injured him my lord replied the lawyer in his dry deliberate fashion
i dont know much about children but i thought him rather a fine lad
his manner of speech was always deliberate and unenthusiastic but he made it a trifle more so than usual
he had a shrewd fancy that it would be better that the earl should judge for himself and be quite unprepared for his first interview with his grandson
healthy and wellgrown
asked my lord
apparently very healthy and quite wellgrown replied the lawyer
straightlimbed and well enough to look at
demanded the earl
a very slight smile touched mr
havishams thin lips
rather a handsome boy i think my lord as boys go he said though
i am scarcely a judge perhaps
but you will find him somewhat different from most english children i dare say
i havent a doubt of that snarled the earl a twinge of gout seizing him
a lot of impudent little beggars those american children ive heard that often enough
it is not exactly impudence in his case said mr
i can scarcely describe what the difference is
he has lived more with older people than with children and the difference seems to be a mixture of maturity and childishness
american impudence
protested the earl
ive heard of it before
they call it precocity and freedom
beastly impudent bad manners thats what it is
havisham drank some more port
he seldom argued with his lordly patronnever when his lordly patrons noble leg was inflamed by gout
at such times it was always better to leave him alone
so there was a silence of a few moments
havisham who broke it
i have a message to deliver from mrs
errol he remarked
i dont want any of her messages
growled his lordship the less i hear of her the better
this is a rather important one explained the lawyer
she prefers not to accept the income you proposed to settle on her
the earl started visibly
whats that
he cried out
whats that
havisham repeated his words
she says it is not necessary and that as the relations between you are not friendly not friendly
ejaculated my lord savagely i should say they were not friendly
i hate to think of her
a mercenary sharpvoiced american
i dont wish to see her
my lord said mr
havisham you can scarcely call her mercenary
she has asked for nothing
she does not accept the money you offer her
all done for effect
snapped his noble lordship
she wants to wheedle me into seeing her
she thinks i shall admire her spirit
i dont admire it
its only american independence
i wont have her living like a beggar at my park gates
as shes the boys mother she has a position to keep up and she shall keep it up
she shall have the money whether she likes it or not
she wont spend it said mr
i dont care whether she spends it or not
blustered my lord
she shall have it sent to her
she shant tell people that she has to live like a pauper because i have done nothing for her
she wants to give the boy a bad opinion of me
i suppose she has poisoned his mind against me already
no said mr
i have another message which will prove to you that she has not done that
i dont want to hear it
panted the earl out of breath with anger and excitement and gout
havisham delivered it
she asks you not to let lord fauntleroy hear anything which would lead him to understand that you separate him from her because of your prejudice against her
he is very fond of her and she is convinced that it would cause a barrier to exist between you
she says he would not comprehend it and it might make him fear you in some measure or at least cause him to feel less affection for you
she has told him that he is too young to understand the reason but shall hear it when he is older
she wishes that there should be no shadow on your first meeting
the earl sank back into his chair
his deepset fierce old eyes gleamed under his beetling brows
he said still breathlessly
you dont mean the mother hasnt told him
not one word my lord replied the lawyer coolly
that i can assure you
the child is prepared to believe you the most amiable and affectionate of grandparents
nothingabsolutely nothing has been said to him to give him the slightest doubt of your perfection
i carried out your commands in every detail while in new york he certainly regards you as a wonder of generosity
he does eh
said the earl
i give you my word of honor said mr
havisham that lord
fauntleroys impressions of you will depend entirely upon yourself
and if you will pardon the liberty i take in making the suggestion i think you will succeed better with him if you take the precaution not to speak slightingly of his mother
said the earl
the youngster is only seven years old
he has spent those seven years at his mothers side returned mr
havisham and she has all his affection
it was late in the afternoon when the carriage containing little lord
fauntleroy and mr
havisham drove up the long avenue which led to the castle
as the carriage rolled up the avenue lord
fauntleroy sat leaning comfortably against the luxurious cushions and regarded the prospect with great interest
he was in fact interested in everything he saw
when the carriage reached the great gates of the park he looked out of the window to get a good view of the huge stone lions ornamenting the entrance
the gates were opened by a motherly rosylooking woman who came out of a pretty ivycovered lodge
two children ran out of the door of the house and stood looking with round wideopen eyes at the little boy in the carriage who looked at them also
their mother stood courtesying and smiling and the children on receiving a sign from her made bobbing little courtesies too
does she know me
asked lord fauntleroy
i think she must think she knows me
and he took off his black velvet cap to her and smiled
how do you do
he said brightly
goodafternoon
the woman seemed pleased he thought
the smile broadened on her rosy face and a kind look came into her blue eyes
god bless your lordship
god bless your pretty face
good luck and happiness to your lordship
welcome to you
lord fauntleroy waved his cap and nodded to her again as the carriage rolled by her
i like that woman he said
she looks as if she liked boys
i should like to come here and play with her children
i wonder if she has enough to make up a company
havisham did not tell him that he would scarcely be allowed to make playmates of the gatekeepers children
the lawyer thought there was time enough for giving him that information
the carriage rolled on and on between the great beautiful trees which grew on each side of the avenue and stretched their broad swaying branches in an arch across it
cedric had never seen such treesthey were so grand and stately and their branches grew so low down on their huge trunks
he did not then know that dorincourt castle was one of the most beautiful in all england that its park was one of the broadest and finest and its trees and avenue almost without rivals
but he did know that it was all very beautiful
he liked the big broadbranched trees with the late afternoon sunlight striking golden lances through them
he liked the perfect stillness which rested on everything
now and then they passed places where tall ferns grew in masses and again and again the ground was azure with the bluebells swaying in the soft breeze
several times he started up with a laugh of delight as a rabbit leaped up from under the greenery and scudded away with a twinkle of short white tail behind it
once a covey of partridges rose with a sudden whir and flew away and then he shouted and clapped his hands
its a beautiful place isnt it
he said to mr
i never saw such a beautiful place
its prettier even than central park
he was rather puzzled by the length of time they were on their way
how far is it he said at length from the gate to the front door
it is between three and four miles answered the lawyer
thats a long way for a person to live from his gate remarked his lordship
every few minutes he saw something new to wonder at and admire
has there been a circus
he cried or do they live here always
whose are they
they live here mr
havisham told him
they belong to the earl your grandfather
it was not long after this that they saw the castle
it rose up before them stately and beautiful and gray the last rays of the sun casting dazzling lights on its many windows
it had turrets and battlements and towers a great deal of ivy grew upon its walls all the broad open space about it was laid out in terraces and lawns and beds of brilliant flowers
its the most beautiful place i ever saw
said cedric his round face flushing with pleasure
it reminds any one of a kings palace
i saw a picture of one once in a fairybook
he saw the great entrancedoor thrown open and many servants standing in two lines looking at him
he wondered why they were standing there and admired their liveries very much
it was only a couple of weeks since he had sat with mr
hobbs among the potatoes and canned peaches with his legs dangling from the high stool it would not have been possible for him to realize that he had very much to do with all this grandeur
at the head of the line of servants there stood an elderly woman in a rich plain black silk gown she had gray hair and wore a cap
as he entered the hall she stood nearer than the rest and the child thought from the look in her eyes that she was going to speak to him
havisham who held his hand paused a moment
this is lord fauntleroy mrs
mellon he said
lord fauntleroy this is mrs
mellon who is the housekeeper
cedric gave her his hand his eyes lighting up
was it you who sent the cat
im much obliged to you maam
mellons handsome old face looked as pleased as the face of the lodgekeepers wife had done
i should know his lordship anywhere she said to mr
he has the captains face and way
its a great day this sir
cedric wondered why it was a great day
he looked at mrs
mellon curiously
it seemed to him for a moment as if there were tears in her eyes and yet it was evident she was not unhappy
she smiled down on him
the cat left two beautiful kittens here she said they shall be sent up to your lordships nursery
havisham said a few words to her in a low voice
in the library sir mrs
mellon replied
his lordship is to be taken there alone
a few minutes later the very tall footman in livery who had escorted
cedric to the library door opened it and announced lord fauntleroy my lord in quite a majestic tone
cedric crossed the threshold into the room
but he had attracted attention in one quarter at least
then the person in the chair spoke
dougal he called come back sir
but there was no more fear in little lord fauntleroys heart than there was unkindnesshe had been a brave little fellow all his life
he put his hand on the big dogs collar in the most natural way in the world and they strayed forward together dougal sniffing as he went
and then the earl looked up
what cedric saw was a large old man with shaggy white hair and eyebrows and a nose like an eagles beak between his deep fierce eyes
but there was a sudden glow of triumph and exultation in the fiery old
earls heart as he saw what a strong beautiful boy this grandson was and how unhesitatingly he looked up as he stood with his hand on the big dogs neck
it pleased the grim old nobleman that the child should show no shyness or fear either of the dog or of himself
cedric looked at him just as he had looked at the woman at the lodge and at the housekeeper and came quite close to him
are you the earl
im your grandson you know that mr
havisham brought
im lord fauntleroy
he held out his hand because he thought it must be the polite and proper thing to do even with earls
i hope you are very well he continued with the utmost friendliness
im very glad to see you
the earl shook hands with him with a curious gleam in his eyes just at first he was so astonished that he scarcely knew what to say
he stared at the picturesque little apparition from under his shaggy brows and took it all in from head to foot
glad to see me are you
yes answered lord fauntleroy very
ive kept wondering what you would look like he remarked
i used to lie in my berth in the ship and wonder if you would be anything like my father
asked the earl
well cedric replied i was very young when he died and i may not remember exactly how he looked but i dont think you are like him
you are disappointed i suppose
suggested his grandfather
oh no responded cedric politely
of course you would like any one to look like your father but of course you would enjoy the way your grandfather looked even if he wasnt like your father
you know how it is yourself about admiring your relations
the earl leaned back in his chair and stared
he could not be said to know how it was about admiring his relations
he had employed most of his noble leisure in quarreling violently with them in turning them out of his house and applying abusive epithets to them and they all hated him cordially
any boy would love his grandfather continued lord fauntleroy especially one that had been as kind to him as you have been
another queer gleam came into the old noblemans eyes
he said i have been kind to you have i
yes answered lord fauntleroy brightly im ever so much obliged to you about bridget and the applewoman and dick
exclaimed the earl
the applewoman
explained cedric the ones you gave me all that money forthe money you told mr
havisham to give me if i wanted it
ejaculated his lordship
thats it is it
the money you were to spend as you liked
what did you buy with it
i should like to hear something about that
he drew his shaggy eyebrows together and looked at the child sharply
he was secretly curious to know in what way the lad had indulged himself
said lord fauntleroy perhaps you didnt know about dick and the applewoman and bridget
i forgot you lived such a long way off from them
they were particular friends of mine
and you see michael had the fever whos michael
asked the earl
michael is bridgets husband and they were in great trouble
when a man is sick and cant work and has twelve children you know how it is
and michael has always been a sober man
and bridget used to come to our house and cry
and the evening mr
havisham was there she was in the kitchen crying because they had almost nothing to eat and couldnt pay the rent and i went in to see her and mr
havisham sent for me and he said you had given him some money for me
and i ran as fast as i could into the kitchen and gave it to bridget and that made it all right and
bridget could scarcely believe her eyes
thats why im so obliged to you
said the earl in his deep voice that was one of the things you did for yourself was it
dougal had been sitting by the tall chair the great dog had taken its place there when cedric sat down
several times it had turned and looked up at the boy as if interested in the conversation
dougal was a solemn dog who seemed to feel altogether too big to take lifes responsibilities lightly
the old earl who knew the dog well had watched it with secret interest
dougal was not a dog whose habit it was to make acquaintances rashly and the earl wondered somewhat to see how quietly the brute sat under the touch of the childish hand
and just at this moment the big dog gave little lord fauntleroy one more look of dignified scrutiny and deliberately laid its huge lionlike head on the boys blackvelvet knee
the small hand went on stroking this new friend as cedric answered well there was dick he said
youd like dick hes so square
this was an americanism the earl was not prepared for
what does that mean
he inquired
lord fauntleroy paused a moment to reflect
he was not very sure himself what it meant
he had taken it for granted as meaning something very creditable because dick had been fond of using it
i think it means that he wouldnt cheat any one he exclaimed or hit a boy who was under his size and that he blacks peoples boots very well and makes them shine as much as he can
hes a perfessional bootblack
and hes one of your acquaintances is he
said the earl
he is an old friend of mine replied his grandson
not quite as old as mr
hobbs but quite old
he gave me a present just before the ship sailed
he put his hand into his pocket and drew forth a neatly folded red object and opened it with an air of affectionate pride
it was the red silk handkerchief with the large purple horseshoes and heads on it
he gave me this said his young lordship
i shall keep it always
you can wear it round your neck or keep it in your pocket
he bought it with the first money he earned after i bought jake out and gave him the new brushes
its a keepsake
i put some poetry in mr
hobbss watch
it was when this you see remember me
when this i see i shall always remember dick
the sensations of the right honorable the earl of dorincourt could scarcely be described
he had never cared for children he had been so occupied with his own pleasures that he had never had time to care for them
his own sons had not interested him when they were very youngthough sometimes he remembered having thought cedrics father a handsome and strong little fellow
it had never once occurred to him that he should like his grandson he had sent for the little cedric because his pride impelled him to do so
if the boy was to take his place in the future he did not wish his name to be made ridiculous by descending to an uneducated boor
he had been convinced the boy would be a clownish fellow if he were brought up in
when the footman had announced lord fauntleroy he had almost dreaded to look at the boy lest he should find him all that he had feared
it was because of this feeling that he had ordered that the child should be sent to him alone
his pride could not endure that others should see his disappointment if he was to be disappointed
his proud stubborn old heart therefore had leaped within him when the boy came forward with his graceful easy carriage his fearless hand on the big dogs neck
even in the moments when he had hoped the most the earl had never hoped that his grandson would look like that
it seemed almost too good to be true that this should be the boy he had dreaded to seethe child of the woman he so dislikedthis little fellow with so much beauty and such a brave childish grace
the earls stern composure was quite shaken by this startling surprise
and then their talk began and he was still more curiously moved and more and more puzzled
in the first place he was so used to seeing people rather afraid and embarrassed before him that he had expected nothing else but that his grandson would be timid or shy
but cedric was no more afraid of the earl than he had been of dougal
he was not bold he was only innocently friendly and he was not conscious that there could be any reason why he should be awkward or afraid
the earl could not help seeing that the little boy took him for a friend and treated him as one without having any doubt of him at all
and it was plain too that in his childish way he wished to please and interest his grandfather
cross and hardhearted and worldly as the old earl was he could not help feeling a secret and novel pleasure in this very confidence
so the old man leaned back in his chair and led his young companion on to telling him still more of himself and with that odd gleam in his eyes watched the little fellow as he talked
lord fauntleroy was quite willing to answer all his questions and chatted on in his genial little way quite composedly
he told him all about dick and jake and the applewoman and mr
hobbs he described the republican rally in all the glory of its banners and transparencies torches and rockets
in the course of the conversation he reached the fourth of july and the revolution and was just becoming enthusiastic when he suddenly recollected something and stopped very abruptly
what is the matter
demanded his grandfather
why dont you go on
lord fauntleroy moved rather uneasily in his chair
it was evident to the earl that he was embarrassed by the thought which had just occurred to him
i was just thinking that perhaps you mightnt like it he replied
perhaps some one belonging to you might have been there
i forgot you were an englishman
you can go on said my lord
no one belonging to me was there
you forgot you were an englishman too
no said cedric quickly
im an american
you are an englishman said the earl grimly
your father was an
englishman
it amused him a little to say this but it did not amuse cedric
the lad had never thought of such a development as this
he felt himself grow quite hot up to the roots of his hair
i was born in america he protested
you have to be an american if you are born in america
i beg your pardon with serious politeness and delicacy for contradicting you
hobbs told me if there were another war you know i should have toto be an american
the earl gave a grim half laughit was short and grim but it was a laugh
you would would you
he hated america and americans but it amused him to see how serious and interested this small patriot was
he thought that so good an american might make a rather good englishman when he was a man
they had not time to go very deep into the revolution againand indeed lord fauntleroy felt some delicacy about returning to the subjectbefore dinner was announced
cedric left his chair and went to his noble kinsman
he looked down at his gouty foot
would you like me to help you
he said politely
you could lean on me you know
once when mr
hobbs hurt his foot with a potatobarrel rolling on it he used to lean on me
the big footman almost periled his reputation and his situation by smiling
but he had a very narrow escape
he only just saved himself by staring straight over the earls head at a very ugly picture
the earl looked his valiant young relative over from head to foot
do you think you could do it
he asked gruffly
i think i could said cedric
im seven you know
you could lean on your stick on one side and on me on the other
ive a good deal of muscle for a boy thats only seven
well said the earl you may try
cedric gave him his stick and began to assist him to rise
usually the footman did this and was violently sworn at when his lordship had an extra twinge of gout
the earl was not a very polite person as a rule and many a time the huge footmen about him quaked inside their imposing liveries
but this evening he did not swear though his gouty foot gave him more twinges than one
he chose to try an experiment
he got up slowly and put his hand on the small shoulder presented to him with so much courage
little lord fauntleroy made a careful step forward looking down at the gouty foot
just lean on me he said with encouraging good cheer
ill walk very slowly
if the earl had been supported by the footman he would have rested less on his stick and more on his assistants arm
and yet it was part of his experiment to let his grandson feel his burden as no light weight
dont be afraid of leaning on me he panted
im all rightifif it isnt a very long way
it was not really very far to the diningroom but it seemed rather a long way to cedric before they reached the chair at the head of the table
does your foot hurt you very much when you stand on it
did you ever put it in hot water and mustard
hobbs used to put his in hot water
arnica is a very nice thing they tell me
the earl too looked rather queer once as he glanced sidewise down at the flushed little face
but they reached the chair at last
the hand was removed from his shoulder and the earl was fairly seated
cedric took out dicks handkerchief and wiped his forehead
its a warm night isnt it
perhaps you need a fire becausebecause of your foot but it seems just a little warm to me
his delicate consideration for his noble relatives feelings was such that he did not wish to seem to intimate that any of his surroundings were unnecessary
you have been doing some rather hard work said the earl
said lord fauntleroy it wasnt exactly hard but i got a little warm
a person will get warm in summer time
and he rubbed his damp curls rather vigorously with the gorgeous handkerchief
his own chair was placed at the other end of the table opposite his grandfathers
but that did not trouble him he had never thought himself very large or important and he was quite willing to accommodate himself even to circumstances which rather overpowered him
perhaps he had never looked so little a fellow as when seated now in his great chair at the end of the table
notwithstanding his solitary existence the earl chose to live in some state
he was fond of his dinner and he dined in a formal style
cedric looked at him across a glitter of splendid glass and plate which to his unaccustomed eyes seemed quite dazzling
dinner was usually a very serious matter with the earland it was a very serious matter with the cook if his lordship was not pleased or had an indifferent appetite
today however his appetite seemed a trifle better than usual perhaps because he had something to think of beside the flavor of the entrees and the management of the gravies
his grandson gave him something to think of
he kept looking at him across the table
he did not say very much himself but he managed to make the boy talk
you dont wear your coronet all the time
remarked lord fauntleroy respectfully
no replied the earl with his grim smile it is not becoming to me
hobbs said you always wore it said cedric but after he thought it over he said he supposed you must sometimes take it off to put your hat on
yes said the earl i take it off occasionally
and one of the footmen suddenly turned aside and gave a singular little cough behind his hand
cedric finished his dinner first and then he leaned back in his chair and took a survey of the room
you must be very proud of your house he said its such a beautiful house
i never saw anything so beautiful but of course as im only seven i havent seen much
and you think i must be proud of it do you
said the earl
i should think any one would be proud of it replied lord fauntleroy
i should be proud of it if it were my house
everything about it is beautiful
and the park and those treeshow beautiful they are and how the leaves rustle
then he paused an instant and looked across the table rather wistfully
its a very big house for just two people to live in isnt it
it is quite large enough for two answered the earl
do you find it too large
his little lordship hesitated a moment
i was only thinking he said that if two people lived in it who were not very good companions they might feel lonely sometimes
do you think i shall make a good companion
inquired the earl
yes replied cedric i think you will
hobbs and i were great friends
he was the best friend i had except dearest
the earl made a quick movement of his bushy eyebrows
who is dearest
she is my mother said lord fauntleroy in a rather low quiet little voice
they had always been best friends this boy and his young mother
he could not help thinking of her and the more he thought of her the less was he inclined to talk and by the time the dinner was at an end the
earl saw that there was a faint shadow on his face
when the footman left them alone cedric sat down upon the hearthrug near dougal
for a few minutes he stroked the dogs ears in silence and looked at the fire
the earl watched him
the boys eyes looked wistful and thoughtful and once or twice he gave a little sigh
the earl sat still and kept his eyes fixed on his grandson
fauntleroy he said at last what are you thinking of
fauntleroy looked up with a manful effort at a smile
i was thinking about dearest he said andand i think id better get up and walk up and down the room
he rose up and put his hands in his small pockets and began to walk to and fro
his eyes were very bright and his lips were pressed together but he kept his head up and walked firmly
dougal moved lazily and looked at him and then stood up
he walked over to the child and began to follow him uneasily
fauntleroy drew one hand from his pocket and laid it on the dogs head
hes a very nice dog he said
hes my friend
he knows how i feel
how do you feel
asked the earl
it disturbed him to see the struggle the little fellow was having with his first feeling of homesickness but it pleased him to see that he was making so brave an effort to bear it well
he liked this childish courage
come here he said
fauntleroy went to him
i never was away from my own house before said the boy with a troubled look in his brown eyes
it makes a person feel a strange feeling when he has to stay all night in another persons castle instead of in his own house
but dearest is not very far away from me
she told me to remember thatandand im sevenand i can look at the picture she gave me
he put his hand in his pocket and brought out a small violet velvetcovered case
this is it he said
you see you press this spring and it opens and she is in there
he had come close to the earls chair and as he drew forth the little case he leaned against the arm of it and against the old mans arm too as confidingly as if children had always leaned there
there she is he said as the case opened and he looked up with a smile
i suppose you think you are very fond of her he said
yes answered lord fauntleroy in a gentle tone and with simple directness i do think so and i think its true
you see mr
hobbs was my friend and dick and bridget and mary and michael they were my friends too but dearestwell she is my close friend and we always tell each other everything
my father left her to me to take care of and when i am a man i am going to work and earn money for her
what do you think of doing
inquired his grandfather
his young lordship slipped down upon the hearthrug and sat there with the picture still in his hand
he seemed to be reflecting seriously before he answered
i did think perhaps i might go into business with mr
hobbs he said but i should like to be a president
well send you to the house of lords instead said his grandfather
well remarked lord fauntleroy if i couldnt be a president and if that is a good business i shouldnt mind
the grocery business is dull sometimes
perhaps he was weighing the matter in his mind for he sat very quiet after this and looked at the fire for some time
the earl did not speak again
he leaned back in his chair and watched him
a great many strange new thoughts passed through the old noblemans mind
dougal had stretched himself out and gone to sleep with his head on his huge paws
there was a long silence
in about half an hours time mr
havisham was ushered in
the great room was very still when he entered
the earl was still leaning back in his chair
he moved as mr
havisham approached and held up his hand in a gesture of warningit seemed as if he had scarcely intended to make the gestureas if it were almost involuntary
dougal was still asleep and close beside the great dog sleeping also with his curly head upon his arm lay little lord fauntleroy
you will be careful dawson not to say anything about it he heard some one say
he does not know why she is not to be with him and the reason is to be kept from him
if thems his lordships orders mem another voice answered theyll have to be kep i suppose
and as to looks mem when we was rung for james and me to go into the library and bring him upstairs and
an its my opinion my lord wasnt blind to it neither for he looked at him and he says to james see you dont wake him
cedric moved on his pillow and turned over opening his eyes
there were two women in the room
everything was bright and cheerful with gayflowered chintz
there was a fire on the hearth and the sunshine was streaming in through the ivyentwined windows
both women came toward him and he saw that one of them was mrs
mellon the housekeeper and the other a comfortable middleaged woman with a face as kind and goodhumored as a face could be
goodmorning my lord said mrs
did you sleep well
his lordship rubbed his eyes and smiled
goodmorning he said
i didnt know i was here
you were carried upstairs when you were asleep said the housekeeper
this is your bedroom and this is dawson who is to take care of you
fauntleroy sat up in bed and held out his hand to dawson as he had held it out to the earl
how do you do maam
im much obliged to you for coming to take care of me
you can call her dawson my lord said the housekeeper with a smile
she is used to being called dawson
miss dawson or mrs
inquired his lordship
just dawson my lord said dawson herself beaming all over
miss nor missis bless your little heart
will you get up now and let
dawson dress you and then have your breakfast in the nursery
i learned to dress myself many years ago thank you answered
fauntleroy
dearest taught me
dearest is my mamma
we had only mary to do all the workwashing and alland so of course it wouldnt do to give her so much trouble
i can take my bath too pretty well if youll just be kind enough to zamine the corners after im done
dawson and the housekeeper exchanged glances
dawson will do anything you ask her to said mrs
that i will bless him said dawson in her comforting goodhumored voice
he shall dress himself if he likes and ill stand by ready to help him if he wants me
thank you responded lord fauntleroy its a little hard sometimes about the buttons you know and then i have to ask somebody
he thought dawson a very kind woman and before the bath and the dressing were finished they were excellent friends and he had found out a great deal about her
all this was very interesting
lady gwyneth vaughn
and she is a sort of relation of your lordships said dawson
and perhaps sometime you may see her
do you think i shall
said fauntleroy
i should like that
i never knew any little girls but i always like to look at them
when he went into the adjoining room to take his breakfast and saw what a great room it was and found there was another adjoining it which
i am a very little boy he said rather wistfully to live in such a large castle and have so many big roomsdont you think so
said dawson you feel just a little strange at first thats all but youll get over that very soon and then youll like it here
its such a beautiful place you know
its a very beautiful place of course said fauntleroy with a little sigh but i should like it better if i didnt miss dearest so
i always had my breakfast with her in the morning and put the sugar and cream in her tea for her and handed her the toast
that made it very sociable of course
answered dawson comfortingly you know you can see her every day and theres no knowing how much youll have to tell her
wait till youve walked about a bit and seen thingsthe dogs and the stables with all the horses in them
theres one of them i know youll like to see is there
exclaimed fauntleroy im very fond of horses
i was very fond of jim
he was the horse that belonged to mr
hobbs grocery wagon
he was a beautiful horse when he wasnt balky
well said dawson you just wait till youve seen whats in the stables
and deary me you havent looked even into the very next room yet
what is there
asked fauntleroy
wait until youve had your breakfast and then you shall see said
at this he naturally began to grow curious and he applied himself assiduously to his breakfast
it seemed to him that there must be something worth looking at in the next room dawson had such a consequential mysterious air
now then he said slipping off his seat a few minutes later ive had enough
can i go and look at it
dawson nodded and led the way looking more mysterious and important than ever
he began to be very much interested indeed
when she opened the door of the room he stood upon the threshold and looked about him in amazement
he did not speak he only put his hands in his pockets and stood there flushing up to his forehead and looking in
he flushed up because he was so surprised and for the moment excited
to see such a place was enough to surprise any ordinary boy
the room was a large one too as all the rooms seemed to be and it appeared to him more beautiful than the rest only in a different way
it looks like a boys room he said at last catching his breath a little
whom do they belong to
go and look at them said dawson
they belong to you
he cried to me
why do they belong to me
who gave them to me
and he sprang forward with a gay little shout
it seemed almost too much to be believed
it was grandpapa
he said with his eyes as bright as stars
i know it was grandpapa
yes it was his lordship said dawson and if you will be a nice little gentleman and not fret about things and will enjoy yourself and be happy all the day he will give you anything you ask for
it was a tremendously exciting morning
there were so many things to be examined so many experiments to be tried each novelty was so absorbing that he could scarcely turn from it to look at the next
did you ever know any one he said to dawson who had such a kind grandfather
dawsons face wore an uncertain expression for a moment
she had not a very high opinion of his lordship the earl
she had not been in the house many days but she had been there long enough to hear the old noblemans peculiarities discussed very freely in the servants hall
an of all the wicious savage hilltempered hold fellows it was ever my hillluck to wear livery hunder the tallest footman had said hes the wiolentest and wust by a long shot
and this particular footman whose name was thomas had also repeated to his companions below stairs some of the earls remarks to mr
havisham when they had been discussing these very preparations
give him his own way and fill his rooms with toys my lord had said
give him what will amuse him and hell forget about his mother quickly enough
amuse him and fill his mind with other things and we shall have no trouble
thats boy nature
so perhaps having had this truly amiable object in view it did not please him so very much to find it did not seem to be exactly this particular boys nature
the earl had passed a bad night and had spent the morning in his room but at noon after he had lunched he sent for his grandson
fauntleroy answered the summons at once
he came down the broad staircase with a bounding step the earl heard him run across the hall and then the door opened and he came in with red cheeks and sparkling eyes
i was waiting for you to send for me he said
i was ready a long time ago
im ever so much obliged to you for all those things
im ever so much obliged to you
i have been playing with them all the morning
said the earl you like them do you
i like them so muchwell i couldnt tell you how much
fauntleroy his face glowing with delight
theres one thats like baseball only you play it on a board with black and white pegs and you keep your score with some counters on a wire
i tried to teach dawson but she couldnt quite understand it just at firstyou see she never played baseball being a lady and im afraid i wasnt very good at explaining it to her
but you know all about it dont you
im afraid i dont replied the earl
its an american game isnt it
is it something like cricket
i never saw cricket said fauntleroy but mr
hobbs took me several times to see baseball
its a splendid game
you get so excited
would you like me to go and get my game and show it to you
perhaps it would amuse you and make you forget about your foot
does your foot hurt you very much this morning
more than i enjoy was the answer
then perhaps you couldnt forget it said the little fellow anxiously
perhaps it would bother you to be told about the game
do you think it would amuse you or do you think it would bother you
go and get it said the earl
it certainly was a novel entertainment thismaking a companion of a child who offered to teach him to play gamesbut the very novelty of it amused him
there was a smile lurking about the earls mouth when
cedric came back with the box containing the game in his arms and an expression of the most eager interest on his face
may i pull that little table over here to your chair
ring for thomas said the earl
he will place it for you
oh i can do it myself answered fauntleroy
its not very heavy
very well replied his grandfather
the lurking smile deepened on the old mans face as he watched the little fellows preparations there was such an absorbed interest in them
the small table was dragged forward and placed by his chair and the game taken from its box and arranged upon it
its very interesting when you once begin said fauntleroy
you see the black pegs can be your side and the white ones mine
theyre men you know and once round the field is a home run and counts oneand these are the outsand here is the first base and thats the second and thats the third and thats the home base
he entered into the details of explanation with the greatest animation
his vigorous graceful little body his eager gestures his simple enjoyment of it all were pleasant to behold
when at last the explanations and illustrations were at an end and the game began in good earnest the earl still found himself entertained
there was in fact no part of his duty that the reverend mr
mordaunt found so decidedly unpleasant as that part which compelled him to call upon his noble patron at the castle
his noble patron indeed usually made these visits as disagreeable as it lay in his lordly power to make them
he abhorred churches and charities and flew into violent rages when any of his tenantry took the liberty of being poor and ill and needing assistance
but whatsoever his mood he never failed to make as many sarcastic and embarrassing speeches as possible and to cause the
reverend mr
mordaunt to wish it were proper and christianlike to throw something heavy at him
during all the years in which mr
he had called today to speak to him of a specially pressing case and as he had walked up the avenue he had for two reasons dreaded his visit more than usual
dibble did not know about the castle and its inmates and the farmhouses and their inmates and the village and its population was really not worth being talked about
and of course she knew everything about the castle because her sister jane shorts was one of the upper housemaids and was very friendly and intimate with thomas
and the way his lordship do go on
dibble over the counter and the way he do use language mr
thomas told jane herself no flesh and blood as is in livery could standfor throw a plate of toast at mr
thomas hisself he did not more than two days since and if it werent for other things being agreeable and the society below stairs most genteel warning would have been gave within a hour
and the second reason was even worse because it was a new one and had been talked about with the most excited interest
who did not know of the old noblemans fury when his handsome son the
captain had married the american lady
the proud angry old man thought he had kept all his thoughts secret
an serve him right added thomas hits is hown fault
wot can he iggspect from a child brought up in pore circumstances in that there low hamerica
and as the reverend mr
judge then of his amazement when as thomas opened the library door his ears were greeted by a delighted ring of childish laughter
thats two out
shouted an excited clear little voice
you see its two out
its two out
the little stranger cried
you hadnt any luck that time had you
and then they both recognized at once that some one had come in
the earl glanced around knitting his shaggy eyebrows as he had a trick of doing and when he saw who it was mr
mordaunt was still more surprised to see that he looked even less disagreeable than usual instead of more so
in fact he looked almost as if he had forgotten for the moment how disagreeable he was and how unpleasant he really could make himself when he tried
he said in his harsh voice but giving his hand rather graciously
goodmorning mordaunt
ive found a new employment you see
this is the new lord fauntleroy he said
fauntleroy this is mr
mordaunt the rector of the parish
fauntleroy looked up at the gentleman in the clerical garments and gave him his hand
i am very glad to make your acquaintance sir he said remembering the words he had heard mr
hobbs use on one or two occasions when he had been greeting a new customer with ceremony
cedric felt quite sure that one ought to be more than usually polite to a minister
mordaunt held the small hand in his a moment as he looked down at the childs face smiling involuntarily
he liked the little fellow from that instantas in fact people always did like him
as the rector looked at cedric he forgot to think of the earl at all
i am delighted to make your acquaintance lord fauntleroy said the rector
you made a long journey to come to us
a great many people will be glad to know you made it safely
it was a long way answered fauntleroy but dearest my mother was with me and i wasnt lonely
of course you are never lonely if your mother is with you and the ship was beautiful
take a chair mordaunt said the earl
mordaunt sat down
he glanced from fauntleroy to the earl
your lordship is greatly to be congratulated he said warmly
but the earl plainly had no intention of showing his feelings on the subject
he is like his father he said rather gruffly
let us hope hell conduct himself more creditably
and then he added well what is it this morning mordaunt
who is in trouble now
this was not as bad as mr
mordaunt had expected but he hesitated a second before he began
it is higgins he said higgins of edge farm
he has been very unfortunate
he was ill himself last autumn and his children had scarlet fever
i cant say that he is a very good manager but he has had illluck and of course he is behindhand in many ways
he is in trouble about his rent now
newick tells him if he doesnt pay it he must leave the place and of course that would be a very serious matter
his wife is ill and he came to me yesterday to beg me to see about it and ask you for time
he thinks if you would give him time he could catch up again
they all think that said the earl looking rather black
fauntleroy made a movement forward
he had been standing between his grandfather and the visitor listening with all his might
he had begun to be interested in higgins at once
he wondered how many children there were and if the scarlet fever had hurt them very much
his eyes were wide open and were fixed upon mr
mordaunt with intent interest as that gentleman went on with the conversation
higgins is a wellmeaning man said the rector making an effort to strengthen his plea
he is a bad enough tenant replied his lordship
and he is always behindhand newick tells me
he is in great trouble now said the rector
he is very fond of his wife and children and if the farm is taken from him they may literally starve
he can not give them the nourishing things they need
two of the children were left very low after the fever and the doctor orders for them wine and luxuries that higgins can not afford
at this fauntleroy moved a step nearer
that was the way with michael he said
the earl slightly started
i forgot you
i forgot we had a philanthropist in the room
who was michael
and the gleam of queer amusement came back into the old mans deepset eyes
he was bridgets husband who had the fever answered fauntleroy and he couldnt pay the rent or buy wine and things
and you gave me that money to help him
the earl drew his brows together into a curious frown which somehow was scarcely grim at all
he glanced across at mr
i dont know what sort of landed proprietor he will make he said
i told havisham the boy was to have what he wantedanything he wantedand what he wanted it seems was money to give to beggars
but they werent beggars said fauntleroy eagerly
michael was a splendid bricklayer
they all worked
said the earl they were not beggars
they were splendid bricklayers and bootblacks and applewomen
he bent his gaze on the boy for a few seconds in silence
the fact was that a new thought was coming to him and though perhaps it was not prompted by the noblest emotions it was not a bad thought
come here he said at last
fauntleroy went and stood as near to him as possible without encroaching on the gouty foot
what would you do in this case
his lordship asked
it must be confessed that mr
mordaunt experienced for the moment a curious sensation
and what would you do in such a case
demanded the earl
fauntleroy drew a little nearer and laid one hand on his knee with the most confiding air of good comradeship
if i were very rich he said and not only just a little boy i should let him stay and give him the things for his children but then i am only a boy
then after a seconds pause in which his face brightened visibly you can do anything cant you
said my lord staring at him
thats your opinion is it
and he was not displeased either
i mean you can give any one anything said fauntleroy
whos newick
he is my agent answered the earl and some of my tenants are not overfond of him
are you going to write him a letter now
inquired fauntleroy
shall i bring you the pen and ink
i can take the game off this table
it plainly had not for an instant occurred to him that newick would be allowed to do his worst
the earl paused a moment still looking at him
can you write
yes answered cedric but not very well
move the things from the table commanded my lord and bring the pen and ink and a sheet of paper from my desk
mordaunts interest began to increase
fauntleroy did as he was told very deftly
in a few moments the sheet of paper the big inkstand and the pen were ready
he said gayly now you can write it
you are to write it said the earl
